Sustainability Review 2014-15

From embedding
sustainability as a business
driver across the Group to
empowering individual businesses to
drive sustainability, within eight years, we
have successfully cascaded sustainability from
a boardroom vision to a shop oor reality. Powered by

Alternative Thinking - our bespoke approach to sustainability,
we enhanced awareness, expounded a strong business case
to employees, institutionalised frameworks,
invested in capacity building plus rewarded
and recognised outstanding performers.

The road to sustainability is fraught with obstacles - some have to be overcome with innovation, some with determination, and some simply by
perseverance. But as we overcome each obstacle, we come across doors of opportunities with multiple outcomes that take us to the next level. This
thought is graphically represented in this design theme. The upward moving transverse lines represent the Group's ambitions. The pillars of myriad colours
are the roadmaps of individual businesses. While the ones in red are symbolic of Mahindra's Rise for Good philosophy that continues to guide them all.

BUSINESSWISE

is the next phase in our sustainability

journey. In it, every individual business is driving the sustainability
agenda on issues material to their stakeholders and aiming to set
new benchmarks within their sector and geographies. It is like
pursuing the sustainability agenda with independent teams who
are not only committed but capable and experienced. This
enlarged team, new vigour, focus and greater ownership has
created a multiplier effect that aims to transcend incremental
growth and give rise to a transformational change. And it has
begun to yield accelerated results in the very rst year.

MESSAGE FROM
CHAIRMAN & MANAGING DIRECTOR

Our practice of reporting our
sustainability performance was triggered
by an investor who asked us, eight years
ago, if we had a triple bottom-line
report. That made us realise that it is not
enough to act sustainably; we must also
let people know about it. And we have
been doing so ever since. So it is a
pleasure to share with you the strides
that we have made on the triple bottom
line parameters of proﬁt, people and
planet in this, our eighth year.
We have institutionalised sustainability
not just at the corporate level, but at the
level of each business. Last year, we
initiated the second leg of our
sustainability journey by adopting
customised roadmaps for major
businesses, creating a tighter ﬁt between
sustainability and the businesses. Each of
these businesses is today well on its way
to reaching its 3 year goals.
We have progressed on each of the triple
bottom line parameters in the year
under review.

On the economic front, our
Automotive Sector rolled out
its 5 millionth vehicle from the
Kandivli plant in January
2015 – just 3 years after
reaching the 4 millionth
vehicle milestone in 2012.
So while this has been a difﬁcult year for
the auto industry, the M&M ﬂag is still
ﬂying high.
On the second parameter, People 33,490 Esops (Employee Social Options)
volunteers contributed 229,670 man-

hours towards social programmes.
Volunteerism in the Mahindra Group has
seen a year-on-year surge since we
started with 4,588 Esops Volunteers in
2006-07. I believe that the opportunity
to give back contributes to employee
satisfaction, and this reﬂects in many
ways. It is a matter of pride that the
Auto and Farm Sector was declared
second in the list of Great Places to Work
in Manufacturing and Production as well
as the Employer Brand category.
Governance is also an important
parameter for employees and for society.
So I am delighted to report that the
Board of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. was
listed as one of India's Best Boards in the
Economic Times - Hay Group survey of
India's Best Boards. Only 4 companies
were singled out for this honour.
Saving the best for last, our results on
the 'Planet' parameter are a source of
enormous satisfaction. Two years ago,
the Mahindra Group challenged itself
with the aspirational goal of 'H2Inﬁnity',
and started a concentrated Group-wide
effort to change the water equation and
transform a fast-depleting resource into
a plentiful one. I am pleased to report
that in 2013-14,

the Mahindra Group achieved
Water Positive status with
total water consumption of
3
6.1 million m , and total
water savings of 8.4 million
m3 through the offset
mechanism of a Micro
Irrigation System project we
implemented in Gujarat.

From the start, sustainability has been an
idea that has been transformative for us
and the way we do business. We are
clear that sustainability is integral to
business. In fact it is a growth driver,
fostering innovation, cost
competitiveness and brand equity.
Powered by Alternative Thinking, it has
become an inalienable part of Mahindra
and our efforts to erase the perceived
dichotomy between sustainability and
proﬁt is paying rich dividends.
Much of what we achieved in 2014-15, is
a result of careful planning and diligent
execution of strategic initiatives over the
years. And we will do the same, going
forward. We are mindful of the fact that
our future performance is dependent on
what we do today. In the coming years, I
expect to see a substantial increase in the
number of milestones traversed as each
of our business ﬁnds its individual
sustainability mojo. At the Group level,
we will continue to drive positive change
for all our stakeholders through our
recently introduced framework - Rise for
Good, which binds together our
corporate social responsibility,
sustainability and corporate governance
initiatives. As the years roll on, I am
conﬁdent that we will be able to
demonstrate with increasing clarity that
it is both desirable and possible to do
well and do good at the same time.

MESSAGE FROM
CHAIRMAN, GROUP SUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL

We embarked on sustainability reporting
using the triple bottom-line approach
eight years ago, but its tenets have been
part of our organisational philosophy
since inception. Along the way, we
institutionalised frameworks, engaged
employees, drew up a Group-wide
roadmap with quantiﬁable goals and
achieved them within the stated
timeframe.
While addressing material issues at the
Group level is useful, it is just the ﬁrst
step towards driving positive change. Last
year, we initiated a 'Businesswise'
approach to decentralise and cascade
sustainability deeper into individual
businesses. We encouraged each business
to undertake materiality analysis relevant
to its own business and formulate its own
business-speciﬁc sustainability roadmap.
I see the 'Businesswise' approach
achieving three goals:

Enhanced Focus
As a federation, we are involved in
a wide variety of businesses from
automobiles and agriculture all the way
to ﬁnance, housing, holidays, IT and
defence. 'Businesswise' gives each
business an opportunity to identify and
address issues material to its stakeholders
and be more focused in their effort to
harness opportunities, mitigate risks and
be more effective in achieving economic,
social and environmental sustainability.

Enhanced Accountability
With individual roadmaps, every business
is responsible and accountable for its own
triple bottom-line performance. Each of
our businesses has developed a better
understanding of sustainability over the
past eight years and has acquired the
ability and expertise to achieve the goals
in its roadmap.

Sector Leadership
Business speciﬁc goals will enable
comparison of performance of individual
businesses with peers in their industry
and will enable each business to create
new benchmarks and take a leadership
position within
its sector.
At the end of the ﬁrst year of the
'Businesswise' approach, I am pleased to
share that Automotive Division and Farm
Division are on-track to achieve their
three-year targets in parameters like
carbon footprint reduction, water
footprint reduction, use of renewable
power and green supply chain, and have
already surpassed the target for waste
reduction. Efforts are underway on
Community Development and
Stakeholder Engagement, and these
initiatives are expected to evolve over
the next few years in line with the
Mahindra Rise philosophy.
The Financial Services Sector has made
good progress towards employee wellbeing and volunteering, providing
health products to rural customers and
empowering communities through
ﬁnancial literacy.
The Real Estate Sector has done
commendable work towards building a
sustainable supply chain, undertaking
biodiversity assessments, enhancing
gender diversity and ensuring that every
project has a community engagement
program. More work is needed to
eliminate on-site accidents.
'Businesswise' helped Mahindra EPC
Services Pvt. Ltd. assess its opportunities
better and rebrand itself as Mahindra
Susten in acknowledgement of the fact
that its operations are speciﬁcally geared
towards enhancing alternative energy
infrastructure.

To enhance awareness and ensure
sustenance of natural capital, Mahindra
and Mahindra signed the India Business
& Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) declaration.
During the year under review, MLDL,
Boisar and Automotive and Farm
Equipment Sector, Kandivli undertook
detailed biodiversity assessment at their
locations.
Our constant endeavour to raise the bar
on sustainability continues to be
recognised and awarded by bodies
within and outside the industry.
Tech Mahindra came in at No. 2
in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership
Index
Mahindra & Mahindra was
awarded the 'Good Corporate
Citizen' Award 2013-14 in the Large
Corporate Category by The Bombay
Chamber of Commerce & Industry
Nanhi Kali was awarded the
prestigious TOI Social Impact
Award (2015) in the 'Corporate Education' category
Mahindra Group ranked third in
The Economic Times list of India's
Best Companies for CSR
These laurels encourage us to keep
striving to deliver on evolving
stakeholder expectations. I urge you not
only to read this report, but to share
your feedback with us on what we are
doing well, and how we can do better.

Reporting Process

MATERIALITY
In our dynamic and fast-paced world, externalities and
expectations are constantly evolving. To keep our focus on
sustainability issues that are important and warrant focussed
attention, as they could have signiﬁcant impact on the
organisation or our stakeholders, we periodically evaluate our
material issues.
Materiality, for us, is the compass that provides direction to our
sustainability journey and also helps us to prioritise our
itinerary.
We are gearing up to report as per the updated
GRI G4 guidelines from the year 2015-16
and have started incorporating the
new aspects of G4 in our
Stakeholder Engagement
as well as Materiality
Identiﬁcation
processes.



Materiality
Mahindra has adopted a structured methodology for materiality assessment, followed by creation of measurable
performance indicators for prioritised material issues. The report presents the sustainability roadmaps with deﬁned goals
and targets. The stakeholder engagement outcome can be utilised as a key input to the development of sustainability
roadmap by all sectors.



Stakeholder Inclusiveness
The report fairly presents the various stakeholder engagement initiatives conducted during the reporting period.

06



Responsiveness
The organisation responds to the stakeholder concerns through policies, procedures and governance systems aligned to
material issues.



Reliability
The collection and collation process for sustainability data and information at Mahindra is partly through an online portal
and partly through manual worksheets. The systems deployed for collection, collation and analysis of sustainability data
and information were reviewed at the site and sector level for the ﬁrst three quarters of the ﬁnancial year 2014-15 and at
the corporate level for all four quarters of the ﬁnancial year 2014-15. Overall, the sustainability data and information
presented in the Report are reliable.

INDEPENDENCE
Our work was performed in compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants,
which requires, among other requirements, that the members of the assurance team (practitioners) as well as the assurance
ﬁrm (assurance provider) be independent of the assurance client, in relation to the scope of this assurance engagement. The
Code also includes detailed requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due
care, conﬁdentiality and professional behaviour. KPMG has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance with the
Code and to prevent conﬂicts regarding independence.

RESPONSIBILITIES
Our responsibility is to express our conclusions in relation to the assurance scope listed above. We conducted our
engagement with a multidisciplinary team having necessary skills and experience in ISAE 3000, AA 1000 AS, stakeholder
engagement, auditing environmental, social and economic information and with experience in similar engagements.
Mahindra is responsible for developing the Report content. Mahindra is also responsible for identiﬁcation of material
sustainability issues, establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems and
derivation of performance data reported.
This assurance statement is made solely to Mahindra in accordance with the terms of our engagement. Our work has been
undertaken so that we might state to Mahindra those matters we have been engaged for. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Mahindra for our work, for this statement, or for the
conclusions we have reached. By reading this statement, stakeholders agree and accept to the limitations and disclaimers
mentioned above.

CORE VALUES

CODES OF CONDUCT

KEY HIGHLIGHTS

Our Core Values inspire us to enable
the world to rise and lead by
sustainability - social, economic and
environmental.

In the last decade, our revenue grew
exponentially, business verticals
increased, operations spread to
multiple countries and employee
strength saw a surge. During this
period, governance practices also
evolved and the legal environment
witnessed substantial change.

The CoC has mandated the
appointment of a Chief Ethics Ofﬁcer.

They are an amalgamation of what we
have been, what we are, and what we
want to be:

GOOD CORPORATE
CITIZENSHIP
We will continue to seek long-term
success in alignment with the needs of
the communities we serve. We will do
this without compromising on ethical
business standards.

PROFESSIONALISM
We have always sought the best
people for the job and given them the
freedom and the opportunity to grow.
We will continue to do so. We will
support innovation and well-reasoned
risk taking, but will demand
performance.

CUSTOMER FIRST
We exist and prosper only because of
the customer. We will respond to the
changing needs and expectations of
our customers speedily, courteously
and effectively.

QUALITY FOCUS

To keep in step, we launched a
refreshed Code of Conduct Ethiquette, which is relevant to
current times and provides a robust
foundation for future growth.
Our new Code of Conduct is our
central policy document, outlining the
standards that every single person
working for and with the Company
must comply with regardless of
location. In addition, individual
business units issue policies that
provide more speciﬁc guidance about
certain business practices.
A comprehensive framework, the new
CoC, enables effective stakeholder
engagement, faster & fairer decisions,
transparent & unambiguous processes
and a professional & ethical conduct.
It underlines our responsibilities to our
people, partners and shareholders as
well as mandates us to:

Behave in an ethical manner,
taking pride in our actions
and decisions

Quality is the key to delivering value
for money to our customers. We will
make quality a driving value in our
work, in our products and in our
interactions with others. We will do it
'First Time Right.'

Comply with the principles
and rules in our Code, and
full our legal and regulatory
obligations

DIGNITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL

Seek guidance wherever
required if we feel a working
practice is not ethical or safe

We will value individual dignity,
uphold the right to express
disagreement, and respect the time
and efforts of others. Through our
actions, we will nurture fairness, trust,
and transparency.

Report non-compliance or
breach of our Code
immediately

Various reader-friendly features have
been incorporated in the document to
enhance clarity of thought and
speciﬁcity of action.

Ethics Decision Tree' and an
'Approval & Disclosure Matrix'
to help every employee make
informed decisions
'Q&A' and 'Dos & Don'ts' to
understand the code better
and translate the principles in
practice
Disclosures on various new
governance initiatives with
regards to Violation
Reporting, Whistle Blower
Policy etc.

IMPLEMENTATION
MECHANISM
At the Corporate level, the
implementation of the Code of
Conduct is overseen by the CGC
(Corporate Governance Cell)
comprising four members of the
Group Executive Board, who represent
business sectors as well as the
Corporate Centre.

The CGC reports to the
Board of Directors.
To develop better understanding of
the new Code of Conduct, all
employees will submit a formal
Compliance Declaration ensuring that
they have read and understood the
COC, agree with the Code and will
abide by any amendments in letter
and spirit. This declaration will
mandate all employees to obtain all
necessary approvals and make
required disclosures as prescribed

Sustainability and Us

OVERVIEW
'Alternative Thinking' has been the driving force of our sustainability journey. It is
directing us to think big but act lean, get ahead but give back, market globally but
manufacture locally and target high proﬁts but in harmony with a higher purpose.
Over the years, we have travelled a signiﬁcant distance. We have been taking the
lead and big leaps in sunshine areas, traversing alternative routes, ﬁnding rooms for
improvement in seemingly perfect solutions and adding sustainable possibilities in
our bouquet of offerings.
A native language of Mahindras business narrative, today we almost subconsciously
sieve our strategies, actions and policies through the triple bottom line ﬁlter.

The essence of sustainability resides in the very core
purpose of Mahindra "We will challenge conventional
thinking and innovatively use all our resources to
drive positive change in the lives of our
stakeholders and communities across the world, to
enable them to Rise."

28

SUSTAINABILITY STRUCTURE
Sustainability at Mahindra is governed by a top-down approach enabling strategic vision and action plan to not just steer grassroots interventions, but also monitor its effectiveness and disclose it transparently.

SUSTAINABILITY 2.0 YEAR ONE UPDATE

In the last year itself, we commenced
our migration to the new G4, GRI's
fourth generation of Sustainability
Reporting Guidelines, with an indepth analysis to re-identify and
prioritise stakeholders & material
issues. Our new roadmaps were
aligned with the emerging G4
requirements and we also built
competencies across various Group
Companies so that the data
measurement and management
happens smoothly.
In the reporting year, we have
undergone a comprehensive gap
analysis to identify the additional
aspects required to fulﬁl G4
compliance. Our sustainability
reporting team is therefore well
poised to publish a G4 report in the
next reporting year.

In FY 2012-13 as we accomplished our
5-year Group-wide Sustainability
Roadmap in just 3-years, we realised that
each of our businesses possess
exponential potential to raise their
sustainability performance.

and redeﬁne its sustainability focus.
Each started with a detailed stakeholder
engagement exercise, followed it up
with a comprehensive materiality
analysis and dovetailed the insights to
formulate a business speciﬁc roadmap.

Mahindra is a confederation of diverse
businesses spanning from manufacturing
to services to retail. Each business,
depending on its products, its scale of
operation and the geography it caters
to, has a unique set of stakeholders and
material issues. Each business can
therefore create a larger impact in areas
speciﬁc to their operations.

This year, marks our ﬁrst year of action
in the second leg of our sustainability
journey. Each of the businesses has
owned responsibility towards the
roadmap and has constructively
spearheaded processes and practices to
address each materiality issue.

Thus in FY 2013-14, we progressed to
BusinessWise sustainability where each
business charted their individual
roadmap in line with the companys
vision, its materiality issues, sustainability
maturity and business goals. Businesses
could also time their targets depending
on the scale of the goal.
Each company followed a
comprehensive process to refresh, reﬁne

As the companies are focusing on their
individual sustainability targets, our
ambition is to achieve pole position in
the sustainability sphere and inspire
others to follow this ethical growth
path. Companies like M&M, MLDL,
Tech M and FSS have already
contributed to this commitment by
scoring leadership ranks in the globally
recognised sustainability indices like DJSI
and CDP, and other business are on their
way to perform at peak potential.
29

In the ﬁrst year of our sustainability 2.0 journey, we recorded many ﬁrsts. Businesses like AD and FD
achieved their 2-year targets in just the ﬁrst year. FSS surpassed four of its eight 2-year targets in the ﬁrst
year itself. MLDL too accelerated actions and achieved a couple of its 2020 goals like material procurement
and community engagement. However, there are a few speciﬁc areas where the businesses are lagging
behind and companies have channelised efforts to overcome the barriers and catch up with the targets.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
If sustainability is about ensuring value addition and long-term
proﬁtability while simultaneously managing and minimising
negative social and environmental impacts of business, then
stakeholder engagement is one of the key activities that enables
this to happen successfully and effectively.
At Mahindra, we believe that forging strong and dynamic channels of
communication with our stakeholders is mutually beneﬁcial at
multiple levels. It helps us plan our short- and long-term
strategies better, identify scope for a new product or service
and enhance the performance of existing products. At
the same time, our stakeholders become part of
our overall growth vision, understand our
decisions much better and support
our endeavours more fervently.

Whether it is a customer or an investor, a dealer or a
supplier, an employee or a local community, we make it a
point to address and listen to every stakeholder.

GROUP-WIDE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

As the mediums change, so must our modes of engagement. We evolve our
engagement modules to be in sync with the changing times.

EMPLOYEES
At Mahindra, we believe that only a well-engaged employee can be consistently productive. Not only does consistent engagement
lead to better alignment with corporate goals, it also helps gauge employee needs and wants. Employees being privy to internal
systems and decision-making processes, are also a rich source of insights to improve organisational processes and policies.

We provide ample platforms for active dialogues with employees.

Jagruti Competition | AD
Jagruti Competition, earlier known as
Quality First Competition is an annual
programme conducted at AD since last
4 years. It is a large scale initiative
spread across seven plants and
covering over 9,000 employees.

In February 2015, Anand Mahindra, Chairman, Mahindra Group, launched
MeConnect, Mahindras very own mobile app through which employees can access
the latest news and announcements within Mahindra, apply for leave and track
reimbursements even when they are on the move.

During this years competition at
Nashik plant, operators were assessed
at four different levels: Basic Working
Team Leaders, Managers, Paint Unit
Managers and Manufacturing Heads /
Plant Head. A total of 3,026 operators
were assessed in the ﬁrst round, of
which 37 operators reached the ﬁnal
round and 20 operators were selected
as ﬁnal winners. Along with the
individual level competition, a team
level competition was also conducted
and rewards were distributed to
individual as well as team winners.

In an endeavour to promote and nurture a culture of innovation at MVML, an
Innovation Fair was organised for the third time in November 2014. Over 16 projects
were showcased and evaluated by jury members during the fair and a total of 10
probable patents were identiﬁed.

us was screened at various schools,
colleges and congregation points.

CUSTOMERS
We exist to serve our customers. Hence, it is imperative that we engage them in an
active dialogue where we not only receive valuable feedback from them, but also
share our performance, direction, operational philosophy and organisational
achievements with them.

Here are some engagement initiatives that were introduced
during the reporting period:
'M-Plus' - Nationwide service camp | AD

The customers availed an exhaustive 75-point free check on each vehicle by trained
technicians. They also got discounts on spare parts and labour charges, and won
exciting prizes. Data gathered during the camp helped gauge customer satisfaction.

Celebrating women and vibrancy |
Multiple Businesses
On the occasion of International
Womens Day and Holi, a fun-packed
event was organised for over 60 women
employees of Pune hub at Chakan. In
addition to interactive session, there was

trained professional.

Road safety awareness drives |
MVML
A month-long Road Safety Awareness
drive was carried out in January 2015 by
Esops volunteers from MVML Chakan's
Press Shop. In addition to appreciating
road safety compliance by Mahindra
employees, the volunteers also teamed
up with an NGO and the highway trafﬁc
police to conduct a medical health
check-up camp.

Uday Initiative for CV owners | AD
In May 2014, we launched Uday Initiative, a unique programme with multiple
beneﬁts targeted towards the new owners of our commercial vehicles.

The Swaraj Satkar initiative invites customers to visit the Swaraj manufacturing
facility. The past quarter saw many farmers visiting Swaraj and providing the plant
team with inputs towards achieving higher customer satisfaction.

Under the Farmtrails programme, Mahindra employees get a unique opportunity to
spend a weekend with farmers and experience their way of life. This helps the
employees get unique insights into the needs and motivations of farmers, to design
better products and services for them.

objectives as well as brief them about the companys activities and plans.

‘Rise for Good’ contest | CC
The Rise for Good contest invited employees to share ideas on how Mahindra
should get involved with the Bombay Development Directorate (BDD) Chawls
surrounding the Mahindra Towers. BDD Chawls comprise over 200 three-storey
buildings that were constructed during the British rule. The contest was preceded by
need assessment meetings with building representatives, discussions with the
municipal authorities and interactions with the PWD ofﬁcials. The contest generated
63 different ideas which included interventions on environmental, health and
educational initiatives.
The winners of the contest were recognised and rewarded in December 2014 in the
presence of Esops and CSR team members. Taking note of the plans outlined by the
three winners, Esops Mahindra Towers launched its ﬁrst cleanliness drive in the
BDD Chawls in January 2015. The three winners were invited to participate and help

the 3E model of Education, Exposure and Experience. Through this initiative, we have
been working with 80 strategic suppliers on strategic business planning, managing
growth, people practices and execution excellence. This leads to building processes
that ensure consistent quality and future readiness through an engaged workforce.
As part of the initiative, a workshop on Building a Transformational Leadership
Culture was conducted for CEOs & top management of AFS suppliers in January
2015. It was facilitated through Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®) and
Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation - Behavior® (FIRO-B®) instruments.
Sessions on building powerful teams using MBTI & FIRO-B, conﬂict resolution, making
feedback work etc. were among the topics covered.

MAHINDRA
ONLINE FOOTPRINT
With new-age consumers and progressive businesses increasing their online presence,
the World Wide Web has become the worlds biggest marketplace. Despite having a
large portion of our business interest in manufacturing sectors that are traditionally
not considered to be net-savvy, we have leveraged online space for wide-ranging
engagements like increasing customer satisfaction, receiving feedback about the
quality, building brand loyalty, and getting market responses from neutral observers
and prospective customers to regular consumers.

Driven by our People

Our people are our pride. Their skills are our strengths.

Their rigour enables us to rise, together.

OVERVIEW
At Mahindra, employees are encouraged to challenge the status quo,
dive deep into the still waters of unconventional thinking and unleash
the pearls of innovation.
The cumulative result of this enterprising spirit of our 200,000 employees in over
100 countries across the globe, is Mahindra's leadership status across product
and service spectrums.
Our talent management processes do not end at attracting and recruiting bright
employees but also extend to nurturing, motivating, rewarding and retaining them.
As we build capabilities, we keep a sharp focus on health and safety of our employees.

Institutionalisation of Mahindra Rise Awards and
Mahindra Safety Awards are a testimony to our balanced
focus on employee excellence and well-being.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
We aspire to be one of the Top 50 most admired global brands by 2021. In this
ambitious ﬂight to attain foremost position, we have ensured to keep our ears to
the ground and understand the pulse of our employees. We connect with all our
employees across designations and departments and create leaders across
hierarchies and businesses.
Complementing our focus on employee engagement, is our thrust on empowering
talent through a wide array of learning and development platforms and offering
growth opportunities.
42

We have developed a two-tier HR management approach - one at the Group level and other at the Business level:

THE GROUP HR

THE BUSINESS LEVEL HR

Helps create a federation that is driven by purpose and is futuristic in its outlook
to 'Create Tomorrow's Company'. In this endeavour, Group HR along with the
businesses co-creates next generation practices in People Management and
Governance to build a culture of excellence.

HR philosophy and rolls out
customised employee initiatives for
their respective business.

Leadership Development across the Group.

LABOUR PRACTICES
We are an equal opportunity employer and do not tolerate discrimination in
any form.
We adhere to all the labour legislations and also recognise and support the
right to collective bargaining. Towards ensuring safe and healthy working
conditions for our workforce, all units of AD, FD, MSSSPL and MIL are OHSAS
certiﬁed.
A 'Corporate HR Cell' is in place at Mahindra that charts and monitors norms,
policies and initiatives to maintain consistency of good people practices across
our business segments. Additionally, our employees also undergo training
periodically to remain updated with contemporary best practices.

In 2001, we became one of the rst Indian companies to
be a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact
(UNGC), and we remain dedicated to operate in sync
with its principles on labour standards.

Since 2009, International
Labour Organisation's core
labour conventions have been
embedded in our policies:

Freedom of association and
the right to collective
bargaining
Right to organise and
collective bargaining
convention
Forced labour convention
Abolition of forced labour
convention
Minimum age convention

PRINCIPLE 3

PRINCIPLE 5

Businesses should uphold the
freedom of association and the
effective recognition of the right
to collective bargaining

The effective abolition of
child labour

PRINCIPLE 6
The elimination of all forms of
forced and compulsory labour

The elimination of
discrimination in respect of
employment and occupation

Worst forms of child labour

Equal remuneration
convention
Discrimination (Employment
and Occupation) convention

43

HUMAN RIGHTS
We prescribe to the highest standards of human behaviour and respect the
dignity of everyone associated with us. Any act that violates human rights is
unacceptable at Mahindra.
We strictly condemn acts like discrimination, forced & compulsory labour and
child labour within and beyond Mahindra boundaries. We also discourage any
form of corruption including bribery or other negative practices.
While respecting and protecting human dignity has always been one of our core
values, in May 2009 we formally incorporated the 10th Principle of UNGC in our
Human Rights policy.

We also adhere to the
UNGC principles on Human Rights,
which state:

PRINCIPLE 1
Businesses should support
and respect the protection of
internationally proclaimed
human rights

PRINCIPLE 10

PRINCIPLE 2

Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including
extortion and bribery

Ensure that businesses are not
complicit in human rights abuses

We strictly condemn acts
like discrimination, forced &
compulsory labour and child
labour within and beyond
Mahindra boundaries.

DIVERSITY &
INCLUSION

A Group Diversity Council and Sector-level Diversity Councils are place at Mahindra to
harness the power of diversity cutting across gender, physical abilities and race. In the
reporting year, Mahindra Susten instated a Diversity and Inclusion Committee to induct,
train and inﬂuence the employees on various diversity priorities

Gender:

Generation:

Differently abled:

Encourage women to come at work
by implementing employee-friendly
leave policy for maternity, paternity
and adoption

Foster an encouraging culture for
the young organisation through a
favourable sabbatical policy, and
provision of gym and sport facilities

Conscious efforts are being taken
to recruit differently abled
candidates and provide them a
conducive work environment

Towards this purpose, many policies and practices have been initiated to not only foster a favourable and friendly work
environment, but also enable and enhance employees' productivity.

44

TALENT MANAGEMENT
At Mahindra, talent management is not just an HR process aimed at
increasing business value. It is more about adding value to our people's
strengths, work and work life. We reach out to people across the geographies,
departments and teams in the organisation and extend to them a nurturing,
motivating, rewarding and welcoming environment.

KEY LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES
Mahindra offers a cradle of
opportunities to its employees to hone
their skills, reinforce their learning,
stimulate imagination and invigorate
passion.
From shop ﬂoor to the top ﬂoor, the
inroads of Mahindra are carved with
care for its employees. Mentorships,
training, knowledge-sharing are some
of the methods that bring out the best
in our employees. In the reporting
year too, several new and ongoing
development programmes were
conducted for fresh, budding and
experienced talent. Elaborated below
are a select few:

PROJECT ASPIRE
Project Aspire was a unique HR
intervention by Mahindra Finance to
provide growth opportunities to the
employees of its subsidiary 'Mahindra
Business Consulting Private Ltd.' by
transferring them to Mahindra
Finance. Employees were selected
through a structured assessment
programme based on meritocracy,
transparency & fairness. In 2014-15,
3,188 employees qualiﬁed to bag the
transfer.

Project Parivartan is a residential
leadership training programme for
workmen of MIL. It focuses on
imparting effective living and life skills
training to the union leaders as well as
empowering the spouses of workmen
with life skills training.

PROJECT PARIVARTAN
Changing lives of workmen at MIL

MANTHAN

YOUNG INTERTRADE COUNCIL

The mentorship programme
Mahindra Finance launched Manthan,
a mentorship programme for its high
potential employees. The programme
connects employees to mentors in the
organisation who guide, support and
encourage them to perform better.
The initiative establishes a reciprocal
dialogue between mentors and
mentees to enhance collaborative
learning.

Young Intertrade Council is a platform
to connect, engage and involve the
young generation of MIL towards
making a future-ready Company. As
part of this programme, young leaders
are encouraged to engage with each
other as well as with the senior
leadership to share knowledge. This
cross-learning platform is serving as an
efﬁcient lever for propelling
entrepreneurial and innovation spirit.
46

GROUP MANAGEMENT CADRE (GMC) PROGRAMME
GMC is Mahindra's ﬂagship leadership development platform aimed to groom
young professionals recruited from top Indian B-schools to become high potential
managers, ready to take up leadership positions in a period of 12 to 15 years.

I N I T I A T I V E

The induction programme
In FY 2014, 31 management graduates from India's best business schools joined
the programme. Senior leaders from the Group interacted with the new joinees
on subjects like organisational values, strategies and ﬁnancial aspects of the
business.

The summer internship programme
A much sought-after internship, every year this programme provides almost 70%
of new recruits for the Company.
The internship comes with ample opportunities for students to interact with
mentors and learn on-the-job skills. The progress of participants is closely
monitored throughout the programme. The highlight of the programme is a
personal interaction with Anand Mahindra who shares with them noteworthy
insights and inspires them to excel in all walks of professional life.

Mahindra Dares
the Young Turks
to Dream
The Mahindra War Room (MWR)
has emerged as a cult brand
among the students of India's
top B-schools.

In FY 2014, 66 bright students were handpicked from the premier B-schools of India
to join the summer internship programme. Out of these, over 50 interns were
selected for a Group-level evaluation by senior leaders for recruitment.

PREMIER LEARNING AT MIL
Learning is a lifelong journey and at MIL this journey is made special for the
senior talent by rewarding them with premier learning opportunities. Senior
leaders comprising 'Department Heads' and above can choose learning
interventions at premier institutions such as XLRI, IIMs and ISB in order to gain
speciﬁc domain knowledge from professional faculties.

HARVARD MANAGE MENTOR (HMM)
The HMM is a unique leadership building programme which offers a host of
interactive management modules.
This year, HMM trainees were felicitated by the top management executives of the
Group. All the 59 executives who completed the programme went on to win at the
Group-wide Individual Learning Implementation contest held during the year.

This year, its seventh season saw
an enthusiastic participation of
over 2,900 teams from 36
campuses across the country.
Inspired by the Group's goal of
'emerging among the Top 50
most admired global brands by
2021 by enabling people
everywhere to Rise', this season's
theme was 'Dare to Dream' and
it witnessed some of the ﬁnest
ideas put forth by some of
India's most talented young
minds.

For the students,
MWR is an opportunity
to leverage their
knowledge as well as
accomplish their
aspirations. For us, it
is a trove of ne talent,
disruptive ideas and
innite possibilities.

47

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
An engaged employee is enthusiastic
about his work, excited about new
opportunities, eager to learn new
things and has an evolved sense of
belonging to the organisation.
But we truly believe that employee
engagement is more beneﬁcial to the
organisation than the employees. It
enables us to motivate our people,
gather feedback, enhance employee
involvement, and increase individual
productivity which ampliﬁes our
potential to Rise.

We have a number of programmes
to engage with our people.
Detailed below are some of our
new and continual engagement
platforms:

DELIVERING INSIGHTS
THROUGH REFLECTIVE
CONVERSATIONS

Thoughtful exchange of dialogues
and introspective exercises are at the
core of Reﬂective Conversations (RC)
Skill Building Workshops at Mahindra.
During the year, over 400 senior
executives from 13 businesses
beneﬁted from these workshops.
A number of programmes were
organised for different sectors
including Tech Mahindra and
Mahindra Lifespaces Developers Ltd.
(MLDL) in Pune, Mumbai as well as
Australia. These programmes were
facilitated by renowned faculties and
saw enthusiastic participation from the
sector employees.
Looking at the effectiveness of this
programme, a sustenance plan has
been put in place by the Group HR.

INTERTRADE
WOMEN'S COUNCIL
The Intertrade Women's Council acts
as a physical and emotional support
infrastructure to assist women
employees in solving work related
concerns and issues. The Council
organises women centric events,
sessions and workshops with a focus
on increasing the participation levels
of women at MIL.

HR organised a celebration for the
Mahindra alumni who were joined by

HEALTH & SAFETY
The ﬁrst step to create a great workplace is to foster a safe working condition
for the employees. Rigorous safety procedures are in place at all
Mahindra locations which are continuously improved year-on-year.
Despite our efforts in making our organisation injury free,
we still face unfortunate incidences of fatalities and
accidents. Five fatalities were reported in the
reporting period.

Acting as a silver lining to this grey cloud is the zeroaccident status of our multiple businesses. It is satisfying to
witness that this could be achieved not only for permanent workforce
but also the contract workforce.

In an unfortunate incidence last year,
ﬁre broke at our Scorpio TCF plant in
Nashik. This incidence resulted in
strengthening of ﬁre safety norms and
practices across the factories. Some of
the important initiatives that we have
implemented for ﬁre safety are:

OUR SAFETY FOCUS
We are committed to avoid unsafe incidents through adoption of key safety tools
and practices:
Installing
state-of-the-art
ﬁreﬁghting system
at our plants

Conducting
safety awareness
and training for all
employees

Instituting
safety mechanisms based
on the recognised Kaizen
and Poka-Yoke concepts

OUR CENTRAL SAFETY COUNCIL
We have a collective and collaborative approach to enhancing safety. A Central
Safety Council with representatives from all sectors creates a pool of ideas,
resources and practices to improve safety levels across the Group. The Council
regularly monitors safety initiatives and devises proactive mechanisms to provide
maximum security against occupational hazards.

The Council functions to full following broad objectives:
Improving safety awareness

• Reduction in use of combustible
packing materials
• Isolated storage area for batteries
and combustible material
• Use of induction / CFL lamps in
place of tube lights and metal
halide lamps
• Installation of automatic heat and
smoke detection system at all substations & engine testing labs
• Centralised ﬁre alarm system with
additional feature of auto
generated SMS in case of ﬁre
• Upgradation of sprinkler system
• Fireﬁghting & disaster
management training by civil
defence organisation for over
900 employees

Sharing best practices for ensuring safety
Promoting proactive measures to prevent accidents and occupational hazards
Rewarding and recognising commendable achievements
Regularly brieﬁng the Group Executive Board on safety performance

KEY HEALTH & SAFETY INITIATIVES
We have a number of initiatives in place to ensure that safety is prioritised,
practiced and reinforced on a regular basis. Some of the major initiatives
undertaken during the year include:

Zero Eye Injury
At our AD sector, workers used to face a number of eye injuries due to the nature
of the work. An in-depth analysis at the plants revealed that the main reason for
the eye injury were dust and smoke emitted from the milling machine. We set a
target to achieve zero eye injuries at the plant and initiated some fundamental
changes at the plant. These included replacing dry cutting machines with wet
cutting machines, installation of eco-friendly roof smoke extractor, improving the
design of the safety goggle and installing smoke and dust extractors on milling
machines. As a result, we are a zero eye injury organisation for the last two years.

Safety Parameters in Formal
Agreements
We engage in constructive dialogue
with our employees on issues
regarding occupational health,
workplace and general plant safety.
Speciﬁc issues such as the use of
equipment for personal protection,
sanitation, safety and education
measures are outlined in formal
agreements with our workers' unions.

The major benets covered in the
formal agreements are:
• Medical scheme covering all
illnesses is applicable to the
workmen under settlement.
• Treatment is provided through
ﬁxed panel of doctors and panel
hospitals.

57

•

Family medical allowance is
disbursed yearly.

•

Medical insurance policy with a
cover of up to INR 2.5 lac p.a.
towards hospitalisation is granted
for spouse and two children.

•

•

Ever workman is entitled to
group accident insurance policy
of INR 5 lac
State-of-the-art occupational
health centre exists for preemployment and yearly medical
check-up for all employees.

•

Personal sickness and
employment injury cases are
immediately treated through ﬁrst
aid and if need be are sent to
panel hospitals.

•

Discussions are held with the plant
safety committee along with
department level safety
subcommittee members on
speciﬁc issues related to hazard
identiﬁcation, risk assessment,
determination and mitigation.

•

Accident investigation reports are
shared with the safety committee
members for corrective and
preventive actions to avoid
recurrence through one point
lesson.

•

PPEs are made available for all
employees

Health Camp at
Zaheerabad Plant

awareness drives were conducted by
various sectors:

AD conducted a health camp for
Zaheerabad plant's workers as well as
their families. A total of 74 employees
and their family members took
advantage of the camp and received
preventive medical care.

Cancer Awareness
CIS-Delhi organised a Cancer
Awareness Talk comprising a special
session for women employees.

Gastro & Digestive Wellness

Celebrating Road Safety
MVML applied alternative thinking in
conducting Road Safety Awareness

volunteers spread the message of
Road Safety by giving roses to those
employees who were wearing helmets
and seat belts.

An interactive session on Gastro and
Digestive wellness was conducted at
MRV which focussed on various dos
and don'ts of colon and rectal health.

Run for Wellness
Over 200 employees from Mahindra
Swaraj took part in the health
marathon.
The volunteers also interacted with
MVML employees and Bus drivers to
create awareness about trafﬁc rules
and the importance of following
them. As a result, employees were well
sensitised towards road safety rules.

Encouraging

This premise formed the foundation of the ambitious goal of Pithampur plant to become an accident free unit.
A few years back, the plant was facing serious safety issues. The accident rates of the plant were high with no pro-active
prevention strategy in place. There was a need to review and revamp the safety management practices at the plant to ensure
well-being of its workforce.

The factory team took a three-tier approach to make the plant safer for its employees:

1. Extensive Investigation

2. In-Depth Analysis

3. Flawless Implementation

The investigation procedures put more
emphasis on gathering facts than
ﬁnding faults. A well planned
investigation model took care of the
end-to-end procedures to be followed
at the time of accident analysis.

The process of daily collection and
analysis of accident data was initiated.
The data was shared with the SHE
team to review and implement
preventive measures.

The plant adopted a number of safety
measures and implemented
procedures. Some of them include:

The investigation process looked into
important issues like:
•

Causes and reasons for
the incident

•

Remedies to improve
safety measure

•

Risk control and prevention of
reoccurrence of the event

•

Identiﬁcation of accident
prone areas

•

Developing stringent safety rules
and imparting training

A progress report was shared with the
top management on a daily basis and
was also made available to all the
employees for analysis and feedback.
A detailed methodology to achieve
zero accident rate was derived from
this analysis.

Power horses with a difference

Means of mass conservation

The success of introducing the most fuel-efﬁcient SUV in its class, steered our
team to extend the product line of XUV5OO with the limited edition 'XUV5OO
Sportz' and 'XUV5OO Xclusive'. Both these power horses run on Mahindra's
new-age, fuel efﬁcient mHawk engine and boast of a unique combination of
aspirational styling, advanced technology, safety features, comfort and
convenience.
Taking the symbol of adventure to the next level, we unveiled the New
Generation Scorpio powered by the mighty and fuel-friendly mHawk engine
(120 PS power and 280 Nm torque) to tackle all types of terrain and a new
generation transmission for a smoother fatigue-free gear shift. In addition, the
new generation platform with its advanced cushion suspension and anti-roll
technology has taken safety and riding pleasure of the Scorpio to new heights.
We have also boosted the mileage
signiﬁcantly with the Next Generation
Scorpio. It now delivers an ARAIcertiﬁed fuel efﬁciency of 15.37 kmpl
as compared to 11.2 kmpl in the
previous generation.

Buses are not just a means of mass
transport, but also a platform for mass
conservation. With this philosophy, we
forayed in the Bus segment and launched
the Cosmo School Bus in CRDe and CNG
versions. Both promise best-in-class fuel
efﬁciency.
Safety is paramount in a school bus and
Cosmo sports a host of safety features, like
no-skid vinyl ﬂooring, a buzzer switch to
signal stop requests, large emergency exit,
ﬁrst-aid kit and ﬁre extinguisher.

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC INNOVATIONS
We believe that 'a customer's wish is our brief'. Our innovations stem from a desire to cater
to the unfulﬁlled wishes of our customers. Be it a big game-changing idea or a micro addition if it can bring a smile on our customer's face, we pursue it with equal zeal.
A few of our customer-centric innovations include:

THE THIEF-PROOF MOTORCYCLE
Mahindra Centuro sports a host of internationally patented category
innovations and features like Anti-theft Alarm with Engine Immobilizer,
an encrypted Remote Flip Key, Find Me Lamps and Guide Lamps, all of
which have been developed in-house.

SUCCESS STORIES
In Nagaland, the Anti-theft Alarm deterred a thief from
starting the motorcycle because of its loud noise. The thief
tried everything possible, dragged the bike away, and even
manipulated the engine wires and locking system, but the
Engine Immobilizer brought all his efforts to a naught and
he eventually abandoned the bike.

In Haryana, the thieves tried everything possible from
manipulating the engine wires and locking system to
taking out the entire locking system - but they were
unsuccessful. Their desperate attempts ﬁnally alerted the
guards in the building, leaving the thieves with no
option but to abandon the motorcycle and ﬂee.

I am very happy to be reunited with my stolen
motorcycle, as it is next to impossible to trace stolen
bikes in this part of the country.

I am glad to have purchased a Mahindra Centuro
with its anti-theft mechanism, as it has helped me
from losing my hard earned money.

A SEAT FOR EVERY HEIGHT
In an effort to make two-wheeler driving more comfortable and safe, the Mahindra
Gusto has been equipped with patented height-adjustable seats. This revolutionary
mechanism, comprising a swinging joint in the rear and a telescopically adjustable
locking arrangement in the front, makes it easier for people of varying heights to
use the vehicle comfortably. The adjustment also enables the driver to control the
vehicle more effectively by putting down their foot when the need arises.

SAFEEYE - THE SAFEST SCHOOL TRANSPORT SOLUTION
With its robust design, efﬁcient brakes, frontal crash protection and innovative
technology, the Maxximo Mini Van VX is positioned as the safest school
transportation solution in the country.
The major technological breakthrough in the Maxximo Mini Van is the SafeEye,
a path-breaking innovation through which parents and school authorities can do
real time tracking of the vehicle. Here are some of its prime features:
Through GPS, one can
access the exact location
and even the speed of
the vehicle in real time,
on their smartphone or PC.

In addition to live feed
from the webcam inside
the Maxximo, up to
48 hours of video recording is also
available for effective surveillance.

Any deviation from the
route, rash driving or
accident, will trigger
an SOS message to the
guardians and the authorities.

A MOVE BEYOND LEGACY
Tech Mahindra has been chosen by
New Hampshire's Division of Motor
Vehicles (DMV) to implement its
Motor Vehicle Enterprise System
(MOVES), a conﬁgurable Microsoft
Dynamics CRM-based solution which
will replace and modernise DMV's
existing legacy system.

This ﬂexible and highly conﬁgurable
solution is specially designed for motor
vehicle agencies and will digitally
manage all driver licences, ﬁnancials,
hearings, inventory, dealers and
inspection stations. This will allow
DMV to provide superior customer
service, compliance checks,

performance measures and fraud
prevention mechanisms.
Tech Mahindra has worked closely
with Microsoft to develop this solution
and it will be implemented over a span
of 22 months, starting April 2015.

COMPLIANCE
Compliance is the starting point of
our responsibility journey and we
continuously transcend minimum
requirements by recording higher
benchmarks.

Health and Safety Regulations

All our businesses have established
strategic systems, procedures and
review mechanisms to ensure
compliance with laws and
regulations, relevant to the products
and services.

Product and Service Information

During the year, we continued to
comply with all applicable statutes
and no non-compliance incident
related to product or service was
reported.

The information stated in our products and services, and on our product
brochures, clearly lists out the known potential risks and mention ways to counter
or eliminate such risks. We provide appropriate and accurate information, in line
with the regulatory and mandatory requirements pertaining to labelling, brand
promotions, sponsorships and advertising.

We abide by the regulations and codes concerning health and safety,
and aim to achieve 100% compliance.

Our customer service philosophy is based on three imperatives:
Customer
centricity

built a strong digital footprint with a robust presence across various channels such
as Facebook, Twitter and blogs. Not only is it proving to be an extremely costeffective mechanism to connect with our diverse audiences, it is also helping us
communicate in real time, receive instantaneous feedback on our products and
services, and further our HR goals. Social media is now an integral communication

Websites
Being a key source of information for the audience, we regularly update our
corporate and individual company websites. In the reporting year, we redesigned
the websites of MLDL and MWC. Both are easy to navigate, are full of imagery,
have added features and refreshed information to better engage with visitors.

In the reporting year, MLDL
crossed the 1 lac milestone on
Facebook. The company's
Facebook page offers useful
tips to community members on
improving their lifestyles and
exciting contests, in addition to
providing key information of
the company's projects.
There has been an increase in
engagement on Twitter and
LinkedIn too, reﬂecting the
growing interest across all
Mahindra Lifespaces' social
media pages.

FEATHERS IN OUR PORTFOLIO
Innovation is not just a tool to stay ahead of the curve, but also an opportunity to continuously improve, come out
of our comfort zones and traverse new market territories. Mahindra has always believed in improving its range and
the quality of products on offer. This year, we leveraged the power of technology to achieve breakthrough
innovations, overcome insurmountable challenges and touch uncharted shores:

TECHNOLOGY OF AN SUV. COMFORTS OF A SEDAN
M&M launched a new model of the SsangYong Rexton,
the RX6, with 5-speed manual transmission, a 2.7 l RX270 XDi engine and
a host of special technology as well as luxury features including electrical
sunroof, 8-way electrically adjustable driver's seat with memory function,
automatic headlights, rain sensing wipers, an intelligent 4x4 Torque On
Demand (TOD) system and premium leather upholstery.
An authentic manual-gearbox SUV experience complemented with the luxury
that one desires, RX6 is a signiﬁcant addition to the existing Rexton range
which has received a rave response in India, with the Rexton becoming No. 2
selling brand in the high-end SUV segment in FY 2013-14.

BELGIUM TO GO 4G

THE TECH SAVVY FIFA

Tech Mahindra is the sole
managed network and IT
services partner for BASE, and is
spearheading its 4G network
roll-out in Brussels. The team has
successfully completed a
challenging transition from the
incumbent network managed
services partner at BASE.

The globally revered FIFA 2014 will go down in history as the most hi-tech
and interactive tournament till date - thanks to an Indian intervention. World
soccer body FIFA continued its association with Tech Mahindra, as the ofﬁcial
IT services provider for the 2014 event.

4G services are now available
across 10 communes in Brussels,
covering more than 56% of its
population. The coverage will be
further expanded to provide
access to the whole of Brussels
and other parts of Belgium.
This successful 4G launch has
further cemented Tech
Mahindra's capabilities in
delivering 4G services for global
telecom service providers.

Tech Mahindra is the rst Indian company to be associated
with one of the world's biggest sporting event.
Tech M solutions helped manage over USD 1 billion in assets (such as cell
phones, ﬂat-screen TVs, laptops and other expensive equipment) used in the
World Cup as well as coordinate and transport over 230,000 staff,
volunteers and delegates from over 40 countries, including 10,000
daily trips in a ﬂeet of 1,000 cars, buses, trucks and vans.
It enabled electronic ticket sales and accreditation for
the event, watched by 2.4 billion people across
over 214 countries. Its applications for the
tournament also covered systems for
space management, infrastructure,
intranet and extranet at the
MIL - CORE COIL
venues, apart from
helpdesk services.
ASSEMBLY
Mahindra Intertrade Ltd. (MIL),
Vadodara, successfully rolled out its ﬁrst
Core Coil Assembly (CCA) for ABB (Dry Type
Transformer Division) on March 27, 2014. It was
indeed an achievement for Team Vadodara to have
designed and built this core assembly themselves, without
any formal training. Besides, no capes were involved and all
the tools were developed in-house.

Economic Performance

OVERVIEW
FY 2015 was a year that began with a lot of hope in India. A new government
had just come into power and was expected to shake policies and
decision-making processes out of limbo. But it takes time for hope to turn into reality
and till that time, one needs to continue having faith in it. Although Indias economy grew
by 7.3 percent during FY 2015, growth hastened slowly, constrained by weak demand at
home and abroad.
Against the backdrop of such an economic condition and subdued consumer interest, Mahindra Group saw a
minor blip in its ﬁnancial performance in FY 2015. The consolidated Gross Revenues and Other Income for the Group
was INR 760.15 billion as against INR 787.36 billion in the previous year. The consolidated Proﬁt After Tax, after
deducting minority interests, stood at INR 313.7 billion as compared to INR 466.7 billion in the previous year. Similar
performance was seen in Auto and Farm Sectors as well, which is usually our biggest revenue contributor.
Automotive Division saw de-growth in sales across all major segments. Passenger vehicles including UVs, MPVs and
cars saw an 11.9% decrease in volumes due to the increasing preference for new launches, petrol engines and
compact UVs. Yet we continued leadership of the domestic UV market by posting a market share of
37.4%. Bolero retained the title of being India's largest selling SUV for the 9th
consecutive year and became the 5th highest selling passenger vehicle in India.
Sales of commercial vehicles also came down by 4.8% due to slowdown in agricultural
income and ﬁnance availability.
Similarly Farm Division (including Swaraj Division) recorded sales of 234,766 tractors, a
decrease of 12.6% over last year. This mirrors the overall decline of 13% in sales for
the Indian tractor industry in FY 2015. That said, we still command a leadership
position with a market share of 40%. The business performance did not dampen our
efforts of promoting technology and innovation in our products.

We introduced Arjun Novo, the rst
tractor model to roll out of the all-new
high horsepower (hp) platform.
It is set to create new benchmarks
in performance, technology,
comfort and ergonomics.

Meanwhile, our Group Companies continued to forge ahead on the road to
prosperity. Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd. posted a consolidated Total Income
and PAT (pre-minority interest) of INR 11.48 billion and INR 2.83 billion respectively an increase of 52% in the former and a highly satisfying 157% increase in the latter.
Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. also reported a 14% increase in its
consolidated income and also expanded its network to 1,108 ofﬁces in 26 states and 5
union territories in India.
73

Our ﬁnancial performance in FY 2015 however had no bearing on the general
market perception of our business abilities. During the reporting period, CRISIL
assigned its highest 'CRISIL AAA/Stable' level rating for the long-term bank facilities
and Non-Convertible Debenture programme of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. It also
reafﬁrmed the Company's short-term facilities and debt programme with a CRISIL
A1+ rating. This reﬂects upon the healthy business proﬁle of the Company, its ability
to maintain market share, robust product development capability and enhanced
revenue diversity in the core Auto and Farm Equipment businesses and at the
Group level.
In September 2014, Government of India led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
launched the 'Make in India' initiative with an aim to boost India`s
manufacturing sector.

During the reporting
period, CRISIL assigned its
highest 'CRISIL AAA/Stable'
level rating for the longterm bank facilities and
Non-Convertible
Debenture programme of
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.

As a diversied business conglomerate,
we are proud to support the nation’s agship
manufacturing initiative. This support was
exemplied with the launch of the new generation
Scorpio which is a truly ‘Made in India’ SUV.

"We have to make 'Make in India' work. We all have to do our bit.
I am very delighted to say that we are ﬁrst off the block. The new
generation Scorpio makes us proud not only in India, but also
validates 'Make in India' around the world."
Anand Mahindra, Chairman & Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra Group

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Over the years, sustainability has become well-entrenched in the Mahindra ethos.
When we call our social and environmental expenditures as investments, it is not for
political correctness; it is because they have started bearing us rich returns.
Mahindra Group Companies continue to blur the lines between being good and
doing well by exploring business opportunities in sustainability practices. In addition
to extensive business interests in alternative energy and technology sectors, we are
also focussing on introducing newer business models based on Rise for Good and
realigning existing businesses. Thus, this year Mahindra EPC Services Ltd. was
rebranded as Mahindra Susten in line with its core business of developing alternative
energy infrastructure. Mahindra Reva's Future of Mobility concept continues to
encompass the 5Cs framework of Clean, Convenient, Connected, Clever and Costeffective vehicle technology. In the reporting year, we introduced a limited period
INR 1 lac incentive on the Mahindra Reva e20 even before the Government of Indias
FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles in
India) came into force, starting April 01, 2015.

Innovation is one of the key
tools that enables us to
achieve responsible business
excellence. Over the years,
we have continued to invest
signicantly in R&D. The
aim is to build on our
culture of innovation and
unveil products & services
which are both disruptive
and sustainable, enabling
India to Rise.

BEYOND FINANCIALS

GIVING WHEELS TO GLOBAL DREAMS
MTWL acquires 51% stake in Peugeot Scooters
Over the past few years, Mahindra has strengthened its position in the two-wheeler
segment globally. In January 2015, the global ambitions of Mahindra Group received
a tremendous shot in the arm when Mahindra Two Wheelers Ltd. (MTWL) completed
all the necessary formalities for acquiring 51% stake in Peugeot Motocycles (PMTC),
part of the Euro 54 billion PSA Group based in France.
PMTC (a.k.a. Peugeot Scooters), a key player in urban mobility in Europe for 116 years,
is the oldest motorised two-wheeler manufacturer in the world. It offers one of the
most comprehensive range of scooters and mopeds, from 50cc to 400cc, including the
successful three-wheeled scooter Metropolis in the European market.
The coming together of Mahindra and Peugeot is expected to beneﬁt the
two-wheeler businesses of both companies. Mahindra offers access to the India
market, mass market product technology and competence in marketing while Peugeot
brings premium range, a strong European footprint and a globally recognised brand.

This partnership would enable both MTWL and PMTC to speed their international
expansion by driving synergies and leveraging respective strengths of both parties.

FINANCIAL IMPLICATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change is real and here for us to
see, feel and endure. It affects the natural
world directly, which in turn affects the
corporate world. In the long run, it can
change consumer preferences, increase
energy costs, restrict access to resources
like water and adversely affect human
capital. Moreover, it has already started
inﬂuencing an organisations perception
in the minds of its customer and
consumer base. Our businesses involve
both manufacturing and agricultural
sectors, thereby making us all the more
susceptible to temperamental weathers
and changing climates.
Most often, an opportunity is a problem
turned inside out. Our sustainability
journey started, as it usually does, by
identifying and implementing energy
saving and emission reducing
mechanisms in our processes. The results
were quick and encouraging. But over
the years, our abilities and expertise have
graduated to a level where today, we see
tremendous business opportunities in
addressing climate change.
While we continue to keep a sharp focus
on our carbon footprint, we understand

that the march of climate change can
only be arrested through a collaborative
effort. Hence, we take part in diverse
national and international think tanks,
councils and advisory bodies to effect a
larger and more long-term positive
change.
As one of the thought leaders in
sustainability, it is our privilege to distil
and disseminate climate change best
practices to a wider audience. The
process of cascading begins from our
supply chain and other stakeholders.
Hence, we engage with relevant
stakeholders and mentor them on
climate risk and sustainable practices
that will help mitigate this risk.

Tech Mahindra was ranked 2nd and became one of the
only ve Indian companies to feature in CDP's Climate
Leadership Index 2014. This is testament to its
commitment in adopting measures to cut emissions and
decelerate, if not mitigate climate change.

81

LOCAL SUPPLY
In recent years, we have been steadfast towards achieving our global ambitions. But while we have trained our vision to foreign
shores, our intention to localise our production and operation remains strong as ever. Although the boundaries of India remain
the de facto deﬁnition of local supply, some businesses have their own deﬁnition and boundary of what constitutes as local.
This is based on its industry requirements and other on-ground realities like access to technology and know-how, tax and duty
regimes, and supply of skilled manpower. But the objective remains to promote local talent and give it an opportunity to ﬂourish
on a larger scale.
That said, we have exacting quality standards and stringent processes to identify and empanel our suppliers. Some of the factors
inﬂuencing supplier selection include:

Costs

Performance and
on-time delivery

Compliance on environment,
health and safety guidelines

Environmental Performance

OVERVIEW
During the reporting period, we progressed well on our environmental
agenda. Notable milestones include turning Water Positive as a Group and
Mahindra Lifespaces conducting a Natural Capital proﬁling - a ﬁrst in the Group.
While we marched ahead to achieve our big goals faster and sooner, we kept a
sharp focus on introspective small steps that eliminated roadblocks and helped
lay the foundation for big impacts. This resulted in enhanced environmental
performance in areas of energy conservation, water reduction and waste
management across the Group.

We embarked on new initiatives across our value chain to
ensure that we created better value for our customers
and our stakeholders while growing our business.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Our approach to environment management stems from our core purpose to drive
positive change in the lives of our stakeholders and enable them to Rise. It is rooted
in our belief that only businesses that embrace sustainability and environment
efﬁciency will generate long-term value for their stakeholders.
Thus environmental efﬁciency is central to all our processes, products and premises.
We are committed to make a positive difference across our entire product lifecycle.
From green manufacturing facilities to imbibing green consciousness in our people,
our approach to environmental sustainability covers all the high-impact material
issues across our businesses.

We consistently raise the bar and set ourselves ambitious
targets and goals. We leverage Alternative Thinking to
unleash new ideas to achieve these goals.

83

ENVIRONMENT POLICIES
Mahindra is committed to make its products and services environmentally sound and secure. This commitment to environment
management is reﬂected in our Environment Policy. The aim of the Policy is to reduce the organisation's carbon and ecological
footprint, maintain balance in the eco-system, and create long-lasting value for business and society.
The Policy, which was originally formulated for Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., has been cascaded across Group Companies. The
Group Companies not only comply with all the laws and regulations pertaining to environment, they also assume leadership
roles in various green disciplines.
Adherence to the policy is the responsibility of each employee at Mahindra. This implementation is overseen by plant managers
of respective facilities.
For our Environment Policy; please refer to Sustainability Report 2009-10. All manufacturing plants of M&M are certiﬁed with
ISO-14001-2004 Environment Management System.

GREEN IT GUIDELINES

GREEN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT POLICY

To ensure that we use Information
Technology (IT) more efﬁciently, we
formulated the Green IT guidelines
in 2008-09. These guidelines help us
embrace more efﬁcient processes
for sourcing, management and
disposal of IT equipment. All Group
IT agencies and users are committed
to adhere to these guidelines.

We recognise that integrated management approach works best, when one
wants to achieve sustainability throughout the value chain. We therefore
proactively engage with our suppliers and vendors to incorporate environmentfriendly practices beyond our factory gates and encourage them to adopt green
initiatives.

ENGAGING WITH SUPPLIERS
MLDL organised suppliers and contractors meets in the West, North and South
zones in Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai respectively. Participating suppliers at all the
three places witnessed presentations on sustainable operational practices as well
as a dialogue session.
Suppliers gained knowledge on various sustainability aspects such as energy
conservation, water efﬁciency, waste management, use of alternate energy, local
sourcing, operational safety and biodiversity. MLDL's Sustainability Roadmap
2020 was also shared during the meetings.
All three meets saw an overwhelming response with around 65+ individuals from
50 companies in the West zone, 50+ individuals from 35 companies in the North
zone and 100+ individuals from 80 companies attending the South Zone meet.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Our Environment Management approach aims to achieve continuous improvement in environmental performance in all our
activities. We follow a well-structured process to manage waste, water and energy resources across the Group operations.
Environment parameters are now aspects of roadmap. Employees at all levels are responsible for Company's environmental
performance. Robust monitoring practices, stringent feedback measures, continuous introspection along with a well-deﬁned
reporting structure, enables us to be ahead of the industry curve on environment KPIs.

Sustainability reporting contributes to our sustainability agenda in more ways
than one. While we report, we also reect. Disclosures result in deliberations and gures
transform into ground level initiatives and strategic interventions.

CALCULATING SPECIFIC CONSUMPTION
We measure our environmental performance on absolute as well as speciﬁc basis. The speciﬁc consumption is calculated by
dividing absolute consumption by a denominator based on the nature of business. For e.g., in case of manufacturing
business units, it is the number of units produced, whereas for services, it is the number of employees, or units of services
offered etc. The denominators for the Group Companies are delineated in the following table:

*In June 2013, Mahindra Group and Spain's CIE Automotive SA signed a global alliance agreement that resulted in creation
of Mahindra CIE Automotive. As part of the agreement the automotive component businesses of the Group under Mahindra
Forgings Ltd., Mahindra Composites Ltd., Mahindra Hinoday Industries Ltd., Mahindra Gears and Transmissions Pvt Ltd. were
merged with CIE Automotive.
From 2014-15 onwards, out of all the Systech companies, only MSSSPL is part of the Group. Hence, throughout the chapter,
Systech values have been replaced by MSSSPL values alone.

AIR QUALITY
Breath is the most signiﬁcant
representation of life and the quality of
the air we breathe, directly determines
the health and longevity of our life.
Good air quality is vital and we have an
important role to play. We not only
adhere to all statutory norms, but also
effectively use an efﬁcient monitoring
mechanism to keep a check on various
pollutants.
The Particulate Matter PM10
(size less than 10 µm) & PM2.5 (size less
than 2.5 µm), Sulphur Oxides (SOx) and
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) are commonly
monitored at all our manufacturing &
service locations, in line with the
revised National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS 2009). Some
manufacturing plants also monitor
more speciﬁc pollutants related to their
processes like Respirable Suspended
Particulate Matter (RSPM), Carbon
monoxide (CO), Methane (CH4), Ozone
(O3), Lead (Pb) among others.

OZONE-DEPLETING
SUBSTANCES
We, at Mahindra, are sensitive to
the harmful impacts of Ozone Depleting
Substances (ODS) and thus have geared
our processes to reduce consumption
of resources and emission of ODS like
Chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs), halons and
Hydro Chloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs).
In 2014-15, the Non-ODS (R134a)
consumption stood at 111.26 tonne
vis-á-vis 126.08 tonne in 2013-14.

An increased UV exposure
due to ozone depletion,
results in variety of biological
consequences such as
increases in sunburn, skin
cancer, cataracts and damage
to plants etc.

Notes:
The speciﬁc emissions of AD, MSSSPL, MTWL, SBU, MReva, SFD, Mahindra Lifespaces, MLL, have shown a drop in the current year, due to
various conservation initiatives implemented by the respective sectors.
The increase at FD is due to a new fuel mix and projects implemented at Zaheerabad plant.
Increase in MIL is due to a new annealing process at Kanhe location.
Increase in consumption of NPD is due to additional machineries at die shop.
MEPC has recorded an increase in consumption due to enhancement in scope of reporting.
MHRIL and MFCSL have recorded increase in consumption due to addition of 7 resorts and 9 locations respectively.
MRV recorded an increase due to increase in engine testing.
MVML, EPC, MWC, Tech M, CC have recorded an increase and have been alerted accordingly.
FSS has an increase because of better quality of data, while in Tech M, the increase is due to increase in denominator as well as better
quality of data.

INITIATIVES

Combating GHG emissions is deep-seated among Mahindra Group companies. Detailed below is an
example of how individual companies undertake holistic GHG reduction initiatives wherein they focus on
Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.

Mahindra EPC

AD Zaheerabad

Initiatives undertaken by Mahindra EPC include

Reduction in Scope 2 emissions
was achieved through process &
energy efﬁciency improvements,
minimising the need for DG
power and renewable power
purchase.

Scope 1
emissions:
PUC check for
vehicles & diesel
generators
emission check

Scope 2
emissions:
Resource (electricity)
optimisation by installing
local control systems for
light and HVAC

Scope 3
emissions:
Regular monitoring
of air, rail and road
travel and optimising
vehicle use

Processes redesigned to eliminate paper use like vendor
payment process form reduced from 10 pages to 1 page and Document
Management System (DMS) to avoid printing.

Due to these initiatives,
the GHG emissions have
reduced from 103.66 in
FY 14 to 90.44 kg / eq.veh.
in FY 15.

As part of the portfolio, MEPC installed and commissioned a
1 MW solar plant at IIT Mumbai. Over and above green power,
it gave a huge commercial advantage to the institute, as the
cost of power from the plant is INR 4.10/kWh, which is almost
50% of the cost at which they are currently buying power.

Tech Mahindra Employee Commutation Survey
At Tech Mahindra, we continuously strive towards a sustainable culture within the organisation and connecting
business growth with responsibility. Business growth is coupled with employee growth which in turn leads to a growth
in the number of vehicles deployed for their commute, leading to an increase in the carbon footprint as well as
pollution.
As an IT ﬁrm, business travel including employee commute is a signiﬁcant issue and one of the biggest contributors to
Scope 3 emissions. Hence, we continuously monitor it as well as take initiatives to reduce it.
An employee commute survey was conducted in March 2015, with an easy to ﬁll questionnaire which captured the
travel mode, vehicle type, fuel type and the distance travelled. In a period of one and a half months, about 2,500
employees took the survey. It was encouraging to see that over and above participation in the survey, a host of
employees were enthusiastically sharing ideas on how to reduce Scope 3 emissions. This led to co-creation of ideas and
greater ownership.
Results of the interventions will be seen in the next reporting period.

90

BIODIVERSITY
Conservation is better than restoration. The Mahindra Group believes in preserving the
biodiversity of ecosystems and its services which are beneﬁcial for the communities and the
businesses rather than quick ﬁx solutions for its revival.
As part of the conservation strategy, during the reporting period, we signed
India Business and Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) declaration. This was not
only to take the lead and inspire other organisations, but also to
mitigate risks and identify new business opportunities in the
emerging green sector.
As part of the IBBI declaration, Mahindra World
City, Chennai went through assessment
of impacts and dependencies on
biodiversity to develop strategies
for effective management.

Biodiversity and human development need to
progress together, in synergy. We supported the
empowerment of Adivasis in the Araku Valley in Andhra Pradesh
by creating livelihood opportunities for them.
The Group's commitment to increase green cover by planting trees under the Hariyali project continued this year.

INITIATIVE
SECTOR SNAPSHOT

Project Hariyali

During the reporting
period, the Group planted
1,557,347 trees under
Project Hariyali through
the combined efforts of
its employees and
community partners.
Project Hariyali is our
biggest environmental
initiative yet. In 2007, we
set ourselves the
ambitious goal of
planting 1 million trees
nationwide to increase
India's green cover and
offset national
greenhouse gas emissions.

Cultivating Livelihoods
for Communities
CHALLENGE

INTERVENTION
In consultation with the Adivasi community, our NGO, the Naandi Foundation
evolved a horticultural development project on marginal, degraded community
lands to enrich their local nutrition, their ecosystem and augment the
community's income.

OUTCOME
The Adivasi farmers, who became part of this horticulture project, started
growing Arabica coffee through organic agriculture. They use only bio-fertilisers,
bio-pesticides and encourage natural predators such as spiders and ladybirds to
keep pests under control.

The Adivasi community in
Araku already had a
robust centuries-old food
cropping pattern that is

Today, these farmers harvest, process and export this organic coffee to different
countries across the world. The coffee has received an international organic and
fair-trade certiﬁcation. They also grow food fruits such as papaya, mangoes, mud
apples (chikoo) and oranges to provide a nutritionally rich food basket to their
own families.

subsistent by nature. But a
traditional production
system was inadequate,
without technological
improvements and
resource planning, to feed
an increasing population.
Modern life mandated
sufcient cash income for
health, educational and
other aspirational needs.

IMPACT
'Fair trade' coffee grown organically and mostly exported overseas, is now a viable
livelihood option for these Adivasi farmers and brings the coffee-growers annual
income of INR 100,000 plus.
Naandi Foundation also encouraged the Adivasi farmer community to form the largest organic coffee cooperative in
the world -- the Small and Marginal Farmers Mutually Aided Cooperative Society (SAMTFMACS). This coffee
cooperative ploughs its proﬁts into village development projects like healthcare, ambulances and drinking water.
Naandi Foundation's work in the Araku region began over 15 years ago and embraces the Adivasi values of caring for
the community and the forests. This makes the programme a success and it continues to positively impact over 100,000
Adivasi lives.

Being India's ﬁrst green home developer, Mahindra Lifespaces is leading the way
on both these fronts. Mahindra Lifespaces has formulated a biodiversity
management plan for its Happinest project in Boisar, situated in Palghar district of
Maharashtra. The purpose of this plan is to develop strategies that can enhance
biodiversity and nurture the local ecosystem. The plan assumes added signiﬁcance
since the project is located in the sub basins of Western Ghats, around 5 km away
from the mountainous patch designated as a reserve forest area in Dahanu, which
is rich in ﬂoral and faunal biodiversity.

India accounts for nearly
7% of globally recorded
species while supporting
18% of global human
population with just 2.4%
of the world's land area.
As population rises,
urbanisation is imperative,
but the real estate
development needs to
tread carefully and grow
in a sustainable manner.
Conservation of
biodiversity and reducing
the effects of
developmental activity on
environment is the only

As part of the plan, a biodiversity assessment study was undertaken to create an
inventory of the ﬂora and fauna, identify endangered and threatened species if
any, and study the vegetation proﬁle in a 2 km radius from the boundary of the
proposed construction area. Transects were strategically marked in different
directions from the core area. On every transect, survey methods for individual
component of ﬂora and fauna was carried out at a suitable interval. The interval of
every 500 m was decided for the study whereas if any special feature viz. streams
etc. were encountered, extra effort of sampling was taken at these locations.

way to promote and
sustain the real estate
sector in today's ecological
fragile world.

Conserving Biodiversity
OUTCOME
The eld study found several species of ora and fauna in the area.

FLORA DIVERSITY

46 species of trees
belonging to 24
different families

FAUNA DIVERSITY

64 species of birds
belonging to 35
different families

16 species of
shrubs belonging
to 13 families

40 species of
butterﬂies belonging
to three families

52 herb species
belonging
to two families

Two reptile
species belonging to
two families

Along with the ﬁeld study, a socio ecological survey was also initiated to understand from the local communities the wildlife
they have encountered in and around the project area, identify problem animals and possible CSR opportunities.
Eight villages - Bategaon, Birwadi, Vakore, Sarpada, Umroli, Man, Padgha and Kahirpada were included in the survey and the
presence of two types of venomous snakes was detected in the area apart from other non-venomous snakes.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
The ﬁndings of the assessment study have been discussed in depth with landscape architect and an action plan has been drawn.
Some of the key recommendations on how Mahindra Lifespaces can sustain and enhance the biodiversity in the area include:

Plantation strategy for core area - fruiting,
shading, and medicinal trees

Green walls

Buttery habitat creation

Installation of bird baths and feeders

Valuing
Natural Capital

CHALLENGE

INTERVENTION
To measure and evaluate environmental costs, Mahindra Lifespaces participated
in the India Business & Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) baseline assessment, which
offers an overview of the relations between the organisation and the Natural
Capital, covering the entire value chain, and the extent to which the organisation
manages these relations.

Businesses value their
core resources: products,
customers and employees,
yet when it comes to the
most critical resource natural capital, most of them

IBBI baseline assessment was conducted at Mahindra World City, Chennai. The
assessment is designed to create a Natural Capital Proﬁle (NCP) of the Company
focusing on Company's products or services.
Based on the recommendations during the assessment and the NCP, Mahindra
Lifespaces will formulate a Natural Capital Action Plan, which will take into
consideration the quantum of natural capital it deploys and aim to make its
business model more sustainable.

The IBBI has been set up to mainstream sustainable
management of biodiversity into business with
endorsement by the Ministry of Environment,
Forests & Climate Change (MoEFCC) India and it is
supported by the German International
Cooperation (GIZ).

OUTCOME
Following are the outcomes of the IBBI Baseline Assessment conducted in
Mahindra World City Chennai which formed the basis of Natural Capital proﬁling.

Baseline Assessment Summary

RECOGNITION

Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd. can be considered a front runner in
sustainability, as per the assessment. The Company focuses on green design of
buildings, and undertakes strategic plantation within its integrated business cities
to strengthen biodiversity and facilitate reduction in temperature. It also
institutionalises effective and efﬁcient waste management, energy management
and water management within the cities it develops.

Mahindra Lifespace
Developers Ltd. (MLDL)
was featured in the India
Business & Biodiversity
Initiative report 'Business
and Biodiversity in India:
20 Illustrations' in 2014.
With this MLDL became
the rst real estate
developer in India to be
featured in this report.

The Company's performance on sustainability is considered to be a strong
brand differentiator. This can be further reinforced by enhancing stakeholder
understanding of the Company's potential contributions to the wider
ecological system.
The Company may be able to create an interesting USP for new developments by
showing how the Company's long term presence in an area contributes to the
creation and preservation of ecosystem services available to local stakeholders.
Moreover, communicating within the cities about the steps taken by Mahindra on
natural capital management, will strengthen the support for Mahindra's
approach and will contribute to a sense of pride among employees, companies
and residents.
Through its role within the integrated business cities, Mahindra may also wish to
explore the opportunities to involve companies within the city in the conservation
and sustainable use of biodiversity. Such an initiative could focus on biodiversity
not only within the city, but also on biodiversity policies within the companies,
where companies exchange experiences and best practices.
The next step in this journey should be to integrate natural capital considerations
in the Company's supplier requirements, thereby further improving the
Company's sustainability performance in the design and construction of
residential homes.

CASE STUDY 2

Eliminating the Chiller
to be Cost-competitive
CHALLENGE

INTERVENTION

At Mahindra Intertrade,

High energy consuming processes such as Rotor die casting were identiﬁed. Their
power consumption trends for the last 5 quarters were mapped. Multiple
interventions were brainstormed and it was eventually decided to eliminate the
chiller in the aluminium injection (rotor die casting) process.

Kanhe, the high cost of
power and fuel was diluting
the cost-competitiveness of
its steel. It was thus
imperative to reduce
energy cost per unit of
produce.

After research and interaction with manufacturers, three alternative solutions were
formulated:
Solution 1

Solution 2

Solution 3

Water cooling
using conventional
cooling tower

Water cooling
using water based
LPG vaporiser Heater Less

Water cooling through the
combined effect of cooling tower
and water based LPG vaporiser

After a thorough evaluation, the third solution was found to be the best as it
involved no investment, no modiﬁcation to the machine and ensured
consistency in product quality.
The challenges faced and overcome were:
Achieving the
required lower
temperature without
the chiller

Interfacing the heater
less vaporiser with
aluminium injection
equipment

Modiﬁcation of
electrical interfaces to
run the machine
without the chiller

OUTCOME
The new cooling process was approved by the equipment supplier. The product
also passed all tests. So the SOP was reﬁned, people were trained and quality plan
updated as per the revised process.

Benets of the innovation:

Usage of cooling tower
and heater less LPG

'ENERGY CONSERVATION - THE MAHINDRA WAY' PROGRAMME AT MIQ

At Mahindra, we
understand the power of
saving power. When small
acts of resource
conservation come together,
they have a big impact on
the sustainable operations
of the Group.

With this intention, Mahindra Institute
of Quality (MIQ) and Group
Sustainability organised a training
course, 'Energy Conservation - The
Mahindra Way' at MIQ, Nashik from
3rd to 5th November, 2014. This was
the third batch to undergo this
training.
The objective of the training was to
impart knowledge on effective asset
selection, resource utilisation, process
optimisation and operational
efﬁciency, plus share the latest

techniques and advancements in the
ﬁeld of energy management, with a
speciﬁc emphasis on how to reduce
electrical and thermal energy usage.
Internal trainers from M&M and
Powerol along with external faculty
members from various companies,
shared their knowledge and
experience on various topics. The
training was attended by 33
participants from various Mahindra
Group companies and Mahindra
suppliers.

WATER
Turning negatives into positives needs

courage, commitment and vision.
In FY 2012 -13 we launched an ambitious project 'H20 to H2Inﬁnity'
to change the then existing water equation and transform a
fast-depleting reserve, back to tomorrow's inﬁnite resource.
The aim is to ensure that there is enough water
available for a growing India.

But, this is
just a milestone,
we continue on our
journey recharged and all our
businesses and divisions continue
to contribute in their own way to
conserve every drop of water through
innovations and initiatives.

In pursuance of this goal, in FY 2013 -14,
we crossed an important milestone as
the Mahindra Group achieved
Water Positive status.

105

The Group marked the start of a focused and accelerated effort to conserve water in 201112 with a 360o water management programme, H2Innity. This programme brought
about a massive change in the consumption and conservation of water - not just within
our operations, but also by local communities, our vendors as well as our customers.

Note: NIS - Not in Scope.
The speciﬁc water consumption of MSSSPL,
MTWL, SBU, MReva, SFD, Mahindra
Lifespaces has dropped in the current year,
due to various water conservation projects
implemented by the respective sectors.
MIL has recorded an increase in speciﬁc
consumption as rainwater was replaced
with groundwater at two units in Kanhe
and one unit in Bhopal.
Speciﬁc water usage has increased due to
enhanced water consumption by customers
and not MWC alone, annual usage will
differ based on the activity undertaken by
customers.
FSS and MLL have recorded an increase in
the speciﬁc water consumption due to
reporting of better quality data.
Mahindra World City supplies water to
Mahindra Research Valley, Nova, Iris Court
and Aqualily locations of Mahindra
Lifespaces. To avoid double accounting, the
Group consumption does not include the
water consumption of these three sites in
the year 2014-15; however it has been
included in respective sector's water

Turning Negative to
Water Positive
CHALLENGE

INTERVENTION
Businesses are now taking interest in the conservation of this precious resource.
Mahindra Group is a frontrunner in this endeavour. M&M's Farm Division took up a
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project on Micro Irrigation System in
association with the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change).
Under the project, farmers were encouraged to use an efﬁcient irrigation system
such as drip and sprinkler irrigation, compared to the conventional ﬂood method of
irrigation. FD sold drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation systems to farmers in
Gujarat in the year FY 2012-13.

Water is an essential
commodity for
continuation of
industrial activity.
In recent times, its
availability is becoming an
alarming concern. In a

WATER SAVINGS: 48%

survey conducted by FICCI
on Water Use in the Indian
Industry in 2011, 60% of the
respondents felt that that
availability of water is
impacting their business
while 87% sensed that it
will impact them in the next

IMPACT
The use of micro irrigation systems resulted in several beneﬁts including savings in
water consumption between 30% and 50%. Farmers also saw a decrease in the
use of fertilizers and increase in the yield.
This project also proved to be a milestone in the sustainability journey of
Mahindra Group.

10 years.

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. effected 8.40 million m3
water savings during FY 2013-2014 against the
6.1 million kl total water consumption of the Group,
turning Mahindra water positive.
The veriﬁcation report by Bureau Veritas Certiﬁcations India Pvt. Ltd. (BVCI)
conﬁrmed with a limited level of assurance that the quantum of water savings
thus effected exceed the water consumption of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. during
the period FY 2013-14.

Note: Total water consumption during
FY 2013-14 was 6.1 million m3 which includes
Systech companies.

Achieving Water
Self-sufciency
CHALLENGE

INTERVENTION
AD, Zaheerabad took a holistic approach for conserving the precious resource for
the future operations and reducing its consumption. Over the years, we have taken
a range of water management interventions to make the division water selfsufﬁcient. Some of the key ones include treatment of domestic and process
wastewater, enhancing stormwater percolation, and stormwater harvesting. These
efforts gained pace after Mahindra Group launched its H2Inﬁnity, the water
conservation programme in 2012-13.

OUTCOME

Water is equally
important for
domestic as well as
industrial purposes.

The treatment of domestic & process wastewater resulted in savings of 425 m3 / day
of water. The enhancement of stormwater percolation check dam capacity led to
increase in water storage - capacity to 1,100 m3 per annum. Stormwater harvesting
added 2,500 m3 of water per annum.

The industries have to

The speciﬁc water consumption in FY 2015 (till December) reduced by 35%
compared to FY 2011. Also, the water table has risen in the area reducing the power
required for drawing water by 50%. The reuse of wastewater has increased
considerably with 10% of the treated ETP water being used for grill cleaning activity
and the balance treated water for gardening purpose.

WASTE
We follow a two pronged strategy on waste - reduction and reuse. Less waste means less
disposal cost plus conservation of natural resources and energy. Reuse of waste helps cut
raw material costs and decreases the burden on the environment.
This focus on reduction or reuse of waste is pervasive right from the design
stage to the manufacturing process and distribution of ﬁnished
goods. At every step we are looking for opportunities for waste
minimisation and reuse.
Whatever waste we generate is responsibly
disposed keeping the compliances, rules
and regulations of the land in mind.

Hazardous waste is handed over to authorised hazardous waste collection vendors
equipped with the requisite treatment, storage and disposal facilities, while a major
portion of non-hazardous waste is disposed through contractors who hand it over
to large-scale recycling units or reuse it.

tonne for containers which they used to
earlier report in numbers.
Hazardous solid waste (Nos.) increased as the
sector has improved tracking and data
collection. Till last year, the reporting unit
for a few companies, was containers in kl,
this year they have reported in numbers or
tonne.
Hazardous liquid waste increased as few
sectors started reporting this year, and in
few sectors there was an increase in the
amount of waste oil due to better tracking
of data.

INITIATIVES

Going Ahead
Plans are afoot to introduce innovative
methods for waste management including

Utilisation of paint sludge
for primer making

Solar sludge drying bed
for paint sludge

Turning Waste to Wealth
MIQ and Group Sustainability teamed up to conduct - waste to wealth, a programme that focuses on management of
solid waste and wastewater and familiarising participants with the newly introduced laws pertaining to hazardous,
e-waste and biomedical waste management. Innovative and proven approaches to waste segregation, removal,
generation of useful by-products like biogas, CNG, briquettes as fuel, recycling of furniture and disposal of solid waste
were also discussed. The programme attracted a record 50 participants from various Group companies including
Auto, Farm, Two Wheelers, CIE, Spares Business Unit, MIL, MHRIL and the icing on the cake was the participation
of suppliers.

Reduction in Emissions
Scope 3 emissions were reduced through packaging improvements,
due to which the estimated wood usage reduction for the year FY 2015 is
128 tonnes / annum.

119

INITIATIVES

Greening the waste disposal system
Mahindra's Farm Division took up a host of waste management and waste reduction initiatives
Installed desludge unit and robots
in chassis paint shop for paint
sludge reduction

Installed acid proof tiles in the area where waste
batteries were stored to avoid land contamination
due to hazardous waste

Replaced wooden boxes with MS cage for transport
of engineering parts saving 2,400 kg of wood a year

Overhauled the
transportation of waste

Saved 4,638 kg of corrugated material by
procuring 13 types of gears in plastic bins

1,930 liters of diesel and 4.2 tons of CO2 was saved by using
hydraulic press which compressed waste and helped vehicle
take 8 tonnes of waste compared to just 2.25 tonnes earlier

Compared to 45 trucks earlier, only 15 trucks are now
required to transport waste

Introduced plastic bins to facilitate waste transportation

120

PACKAGING
As a proponent of sustainable development, it is a huge responsibility to ensure
we 'design out' any potential negative environmental impacts of packaging from
our products. In recent years, we have considerably reduced our consumption of
non-recyclable material to make the packaging of our products convenient,
economical and environment friendly.

SPILLS
Spills prevention is prudent in any business. Spills increase operating costs, lower
productivity and can have a negative impact on the environment. At Mahindra
Group, we are committed to ensure complete safety of our operations and the
environment through a comprehensive environment management system which
also encompasses spills. During the reporting period, we did not witness any
signiﬁcant incidents of spills.

ENVIRONMENT
COMPLIANCE
Conforming to the environmental laws, rules and regulations is
the cornerstone of any successful business. Mahindra Group continues
to adhere to environmental compliances and abide by all the applicable
laws of the land for all of its projects. During the reporting period, we were not
ﬁned for any non-compliance.

121

Social Performance

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
At Mahindra, organisational growth and societal development are two
sides of the same coin. Hence, we approach social interventions with the same
commitment, passion and professionalism as our businesses.
We have been contributing 1% of our Proﬁt After Tax (PAT) towards Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) in a structured manner since 2005  long before it became a
mandate. Hence we were better prepared to shift to a higher gear of 2% of threeyear average net proﬁt as prescribed by the guidelines laid down in the New
Companies Act 2013.

Our goal is to create self-sustaining transformations across
the weaker sections of society by empowering them to Rise.

OUR FOCUS AREAS
EDUCATION

HEALTH

ENVIRONMENT

We also aim to boost bright minds, sporting spirits and artistic endeavours through
timely interventions, regular programmes and ﬁnancial aid.

CYCLONE HUDHUD RELIEF PROGRAMME
In October 2014, Cyclone Hudhud, originating from the Andaman sea,
made landfall near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh and resulted in
multiple casualties and losses worth billions of rupees. Sadly, in addition to
economic damage, it also devastated the ecology of Visakhapatnam district.
In response to an appeal by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh,
Mahindra committed to plant 0.62 million trees in 7 cyclone affected
Mandals of Visakhapatnam district that had lost most of their tree cover.
This would help restore the ecological sustainability of the region, while
also providing direct livelihood support to 4,000 Adivasi families.

CASE STUDY

PROJECT VIKAS - HARNESSING
THE DEMOGRAPHIC POTENTIAL OF THE NATION
CHALLENGE

It is a widely known fact that
if India is to truly realise its
demographic advantage,
the youth needs to possess
technical knowledge and
skills. The Government of
India is acutely aware of this
need and at present, there
are a total of 11,964
Industrial Technical Institutes
(ITIs) in India. Out of these,
2,284 are governmentfunded while 9,680 institutes
are privately-run. Training
programmes, ranging from
1-2 years, are conducted in
126 trade disciplines.

INTERVENTION
MVML's greenﬁeld project at Chakan is facing a severe shortage of skilled
manpower. To tide over this challenge, a programme to upgrade rural ITIs was
devised. We conducted a survey of ITIs across Maharashtra and shortlisted two at
Manikdoh and Ghodegaon, both located in a tribal zone, for a comprehensive
upgradation. This project was christened Project Vikas.
A high-level committee comprising senior leadership from Mahindra & Mahindra
was constituted to steer the project in the right direction. Nodal groups at unit
location were constituted to helm execution. Esops volunteer groups based on
different skill sets were formed to operationalise the strategy on ground.
Volunteer participation for the project was also solicited through newsletters and
internal emails.
The project had a four-pronged approach for overhauling the two ITIs:

INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
Advanced automotive labs like Cut Section of Maxximo, Engines
& Axles were set up and the existing workshop was renovated.

CAPABILITY BUILDING

ENHANCE EMPLOYABILITY

Faculty training programmes were
conducted. Advanced training on
Paint Technology, Dexterity, Welding
Pneumatics, MILE Automotive
Technology, Fire Fighting etc. were
introduced. Industrial visits were
conducted for better exposure to shop
ﬂoor best practices.

To give the ITI better visibility among
prospective employers, a website was
launched. Towards holistic
development of the students, soft-skill
workshops on communication, spoken
English and handling campus
interviews were conducted.

In all, 321 Esops
volunteers contributed
2,939 hours, while 168
community volunteers put
in 1,346 hours to make
this project a success.

CULTURAL CHANGE
Sessions on industrial discipline and self-development were conducted.
Best practices on topics like 5S, TPM, safety, health & hygiene and
sustainability were shared.

SPORTS AND CULTURE
MAHINDRA RACING
Mahindra Racing became the ﬁrst
Indian team to participate in the FIM
MotoGP World Motorcycle Racing
Championship series in 2011 and the
Italian National Motorcycle Racing
Championship (CIV) in 2012.
In 2014, Mahindra competed in its third
Moto3 class of MotoGP with its own
4-stroke, 250cc motorcycle: the
Mahindra MGP3O, developed in
partnership with the renowned Swiss
ﬁrm Suter Racing Technology AG.
The Mahindra MGP3O has taken three
podium ﬁnishes in 2014, the ﬁrst for
Oliveira at the Dutch TT at Assen in the
Netherlands, while a custom-built
Mahindra in the hands of South African
Brad Binder ﬁnished third in Japan and
second at the Sachsenring - a best ever
result for the Indian motorcycle.

MAHINDRA RACING INAUGURATES EUROPEAN HEADQUARTER
To amplify our strength in bike design and development as well as to provide
better service to its customers, Mahindra Racing has invested in a new technical
base at Besozzo, near Varese in northern Italy. This new facility will provide a
MotoGP assembly, testing, manufacture, design and an R&D centre, as well as
improved levels of support for customer teams. This new headquarter is the
latest addition to Mahindra's 'neural network' of innovation, which comprises
existing research facilities in India, Europe, US and South Korea.

MAHINDRA RACING AT FORMULA E CHAMPIONSHIP
In September 2014, Mahindra
Racing became one of only ten
teams - and the only Indian team to compete in the inaugural FIA
Formula E Championship, the
world's ﬁrst ever fully electric
championship.

The revolutionary racing series, held in 10 of the world's leading cities like
London, Beijing and Los Angeles, will also serve as a framework for R&D
around electric vehicles, accelerating general interest in these cars and
promoting sustainability.

The team's drivers for the ﬁrst
season were professional F1 drivers
Karun Chandok and Bruno Senna.
They drove Mahindra's specially
designed all-electric zero emission
race car that produces 200 kW of
power - equivalent to 270 BHP and
clocks a top speed of 225 kmph.

MAHINDRA EXCELLENCE IN THEATRE (META)
Theatre has always been a mirror to the society. It makes us smile, cry and most
importantly introspect on our current state of affairs; such that we can make
things better. Today, despite the technological breakthrough and new media
content, theatre continues to remain relevant because it tells stories that are
geographically and socially relevant, and ring true with the audience.
We designed META to not only preserve stagecraft, but also increase its awareness
and appreciation, and bring it in national spotlight. The project focuses equally on
developing all aspects of the theatre such as playwriting, set design, costume and
light design, direction and performance.

The 2015 edition of META showcased
10 productions in total - two each
from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and
Assam and one each from Kerala and
Manipur. The diversity of META 2015
was evident in the varied languages Manipuri, Marathi, Kannada,
Malayalam, Hindi and English,
represented by the nominations.

Best Stage Design
'Still and Still Moving'
(Vibhavi Kowshik and Oroon Das)

Best Actor (Female)
The META awards celebrated its tenth edition in March 2015. The Jino Joseph
scripted and directed 'Matthi' bagged the most awards ranging from Best
Production, Best Director, Best Actor in a Lead Role (Male) and Best Original
Script. Other celebrated productions were.

Sanjukta Wagh
('Rage and Beyond: Irawti's Gandhari')
and Swetha S. ('Chitrapata')

Best Ensemble
Fall of a King

Note: For more details on the awardees, please visit www.metawards.com

IN-HOUSE TALENT
IN SPOTLIGHT
In November 2014, the
Mahindra & Mahindra cultural
group performed the Marathi
play 'Ghar Haravaleli Manasa' at
the 54th Maharashtra State
Theatre Festival in Nagpur. The
play tells the story of a multireligious group suffering from
extreme poverty, and how they
stand by each other in trying
times. Every aspect of the
production, from writing to set
design and direction to acting,
was performed by Mahindra
employees.
Beautifully packaged with
dollops of drama, emotions and
humour, the play saw a full
house and enthralled the
audience. The play was also
presented at the 9th Audyogik
Natya Mahotsav, held in Nashik.
So far, the play has earned the
cultural group, a total of 13
state level prizes in various
competitions.

MAHINDRA BLUES
Credited as Asia's largest and ﬁnest Blues phenomenon, the Mahindra Blues
Festival (MBF) brings together, the best Blues music icons and bands from across
the world.
In its ﬁfth year in 2015, MBF had a fantastic folio spread over two days, with the
likes of Buddy Guy, Quinn Sullivan, Doyle Bramhall II, Rich Robinson, Nikki Hill,
Thorbjorn Risager and the Black Tornado along with home-based talent - Warren
Mendonsa of Blackstratblues, The True School Experience and the winners of the
Mahindra Blues Band Hunt 2015.

MBF was nominated in 2014, for the 'Keeping the Blues
Alive' award, hosted by The Blues Foundation of America.

MAHINDRA SANATAKDA LUCKNOW FESTIVAL
Mahindra believes that conserving and celebrating our rich culture, arts and
history, ampliﬁes the intensity of societal bonds. Our annual Mahindra Sanatkada
Lucknow Festival takes a leaf out of the Nawaabi lifestyle and celebrates the
grandeur of our tradition.
The four-day long festival brings together connoisseurs of cuisines, poetry, music,
dance, arts, literature and traditional crafts. It is organised in partnership with
Sanatkada, a not-for-proﬁt crafts collective. Every February, history tours,
literature and poetry sessions, and a scrumptious spread of diverse dishes enthral
the participants. It gives an opportunity to the artisans and master craftsmen
from world over to showcase their skills through this festival.

Biodiesel - Biodiesel refers to a non-petroleum based diesel
fuel consisting of short chain alkyl esters, made by
transesteriﬁcation of vegetable oil.
Biofuels - Solid, liquid or gas fuel derived from recently
dead biological material.
Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CDE) and Equivalent Carbon
Dioxide (CO2e) - are two related but distinct measures for
describing how much global warming a given type and
amount of greenhouse gas may cause, using the functionally
equivalent amount or concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)
as the reference Equivalent CO2 (CO2e) is the concentration
of CO2 that would cause the same level of radiative forcing
as a given type and concentration of greenhouse gas.
C2 CRDe Technology - Two cylinder, common rail diesel
engine technology stands for Common Rail Direct Fuel
Injection engine. It is the latest state-of-the-art technology
for diesel engines and suits passenger cars as well as
commercial vehicles.

Dichlorodiuoromethane (R-12) - usually sold under the
brand name Freon-12, is a chloroﬂuorocarbon
halomethane, commonly known as CFC, used as a
refrigerant and aerosol spray propellant. R-22 is a
colourless gas better known as HCFC-22. Earlier it was
commonly used as a propellant and in air conditioning
application. These applications are being phased out as its
manufacturing was banned in the US and many countries
in 1994 due to concerns about damage to the ozone layer.

assigned to it. It means that a project intending to meet
the criterion would qualify for the points. Different levels
of certiﬁcation (one star to ﬁve stars) are awarded based
on the number of points earned. The minimum points
required for certiﬁcation is 50.
The Green Home Rating system by IGBC Indian Green
Building Council - The green home rating system by Indian
Green Building Council (IGBC) is India's ﬁrst, and is
exclusively designed for the residential sector. Different
levels of certiﬁcations such as Certiﬁed, Silver, Gold and
