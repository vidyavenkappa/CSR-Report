SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW 2015-16

Just as necessity is the mother of invention,
disruption is the father of progress. It is wellunderstood that the challenges that exist in
the world today, cannot be solved by the
level of thinking that created them. It is
imperative to apply Alternative Thinking.
Disruptions change entire ecosystems.
One such success story is our 'H2Infinity
drive' that saw the Mahindra Group
achieve Water Positive status. Through
the Integrated Watershed Management
Project, we are rejuvenating water
availability and empowering over 20,000
people in 32 villages across Damoh,
Madhya Pradesh. These are the kind of
disruptions that we love. The ones that
enliven natural ecosystem, create jobs, cause

MESSAGE FROM
CHAIRMAN & MANAGING DIRECTOR

As I had shared with you last year, our practice of reporting our sustainability performance was triggered by an investor who asked
us, eight years ago, if we had a triple bottom line report. That made us realise that it is not enough to act sustainably; we must also
let people know about it. And we have been doing so ever since. So it is a pleasure to share with you the strides that we have
made on the triple bottom line parameters of profits, people and planet since the last report.
Our focus last year was on institutionalising sustainability by adopting customised roadmaps for major businesses, and creating a
tighter fit between sustainability and the businesses. This year we have gone one step further and integrated the brand philosophy
of Rise with our sustainability journey.
The current narrative on sustainability emphasises limits - how resources which were once in abundance are now limited; how we
have breached the limits of the natural ecosystems; how there are limits to growth, limits to economies of scale, limits to human
productivity. In short,

the focus is on conservation and reduction.

This has propelled us to think beyond just conservation, to rejuvenation.

Our Rise philosophy encourages us
to accept no limits and to use alternative
thinking to drive positive change. This has
propelled us
to think beyond
just conservation,
to rejuvenation
and a journey
back to abundance.
We are trying
to do this
in many ways.

Doing Our
Bit for the Planet
Through our Integrated Watershed Management
Project (IWMP), we are rejuvenating water
resources and empowering over 20,000 people
in 32 villages across Damoh, Madhya Pradesh,
with assured water availability, opportunities for
livelihood and better standard of living. This
programme has received the Ninth Aqua
Foundation 'Excellence Award for Promoting
Sustainable Agriculture & Rural Development'.
I am also proud to share that Mahindra &
Mahindra Limited is the first company globally
to sign the EP-100 programme launched by The
Climate Group. The programme aims to get
some of the world's most influential businesses
to commit to doubling their energy productivity
and maximising the economic output from each
unit used, by 2030. Within our locations, we are
reconfiguring the energy mix to include energy
from abundant sources. We have commissioned
solar power plants worth 2.5 MWp this year.
Beyond our walls, Susten, our solar EPC vertical
executed external projects of 544 MWp.
The Mahindra Group has planted 1.23 million
trees this year as part of Project Hariyali, our
continued endeavour to add to India's green
cover. This brings the total number of trees
planted since the inception of this initiative
to over 9 million.

01

Keeping Our
Commitments to
Communities
India is in the throes of an
agrarian crisis and farmer
suicides are alarmingly high.
To help address this issue, the
Group launched 'Seed the Rise'India's largest crowdfunded
CSR effort. This digital initiative
raises funds from urban
centres for the welfare of
farmers, and the total amount
collected is matched by the
Group. INR 10 million was raised
from donors in a period of 40
days. Another initiative is our
start-up Trringo, through which
we are developing an
ecosystem of organised rental
of farm equipment in rural
India. The objective is to
provide the benefits of
mechanisation to economically
marginalised farmers.
As part of our community
outreach, we are committed to
help the government in
addressing city cleanliness
issues and are working closely
with Municipal Corporation of
Greater Mumbai on a
comprehensive, four-phased
'Swachhmev Jayate' exercise.

Forging
Global Bonds
We continue our quest for learning
from the best globally by
collaborating with internationally
recognised bodies in the field of
sustainability. The United Nations
Climate Change Conference COP 21 in
Paris has given a fresh impetus to
aligned action on climate change. I
witnessed this impetus first hand,
when I had the honour of addressing
the gathering at the signing ceremony
of the Paris Agreement at the United
Nations HQ in New York, as the
representative of the corporate world.
Looking ahead, the journey from
constraints to abundance will be long
and complex. Nevertheless, it is the
only long term solution and I am sure
that with our heightened awareness,
enthusiasm and dedication, we will
rise to the challenge.

MESSAGE FROM CHAIRMAN,
GROUP SUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL

This year has been a very special one in our sustainability journey. At Mahindra, we have been focussing on

rejuvenating ecosystems, re-energising communities,
and reconfiguring our products and supply chain
to ensure sustainable growth, and also involving our stakeholders
across the spectrum in addressing issues of sustainability.

Complementing the sustainability report
is our newly-developed
Sustainability Dashboard,
which helps us monitor
progress on sustainability
parameters across
all businesses in a
structured manner.

Promoting
Product Performance

Responding to Sustainability
Measurement Indices

In the Auto and Farm divisions, our focus
continued to be on rolling out green,
smart & inclusive products and initiatives.
e-Maxximo, the electric vehicle pilot
project was launched as part of the Indian
Government's National Electric Mobility
Mission Plan. GenZe 2.0, the world's first
connected electric scooter, was launched
in the US in December 2015 and the first
waterless car washing service station
was rolled out in India. Additionally, we
introduced new-generation lighter tractors
with increased fuel efficiency and greater
versatility across 15 hp, 45 hp and 60 hp
categories, in order to better serve a wide
spectrum of farmers.

This year our disclosures conform to the fourth generation ‘GRI G4 - CORE
Option’. This enhances the quality of our sustainability report by making it
focus on issues which are of critical importance to our stakeholders. In
addition, the Mahindra Group has also reported its performance against the
10-point declaration of the India Business & Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI).

Partnering the Supply Chain
We re-engineered our supply chain
management system to streamline and
improve the environmental footprint of
suppliers in our Auto & Farm divisions. A
number of improvements in packaging
and transportation were identified and
implemented, leading to significant
outcomes such as a 31% decrease in the
use of wood in packaging.

Addressing
Operational Efficiency
We reduced our dependence on fresh
water by greater use of recycling. Our
Igatpuri facility set up a 10 kl/day bio-filter
plant to treat water from the canteen,
yielding twin benefits of water
conservation and organic manure
generation. In a similar effort, Mahindra
Research Valley in collaboration with
Mahindra World City commissioned a bioCNG plant which can convert 10 tons of
food waste every day into biogas.

with them is not only limited to sharing the

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

All stakeholders - whether external like the shareholders,
debtholders, trade creditors, suppliers, customers and
communities or internal - like the board of directors, executives
and other employees can prosper together sustainably, only if
there is a strong commitment to business principles.

The governance framework at M&M
brings all our auto and farm sector
subsidiaries, associates and joint
ventures under its ambit and firmly
instils the Group's objectives in everyday
operations. It includes comprehensive
monitoring of the progress and
spearheading operational excellence
across those verticals.
M&M Limited, the flagship Company of
the Mahindra Group directly runs two
businesses: Automotive Division and the
Farm Division; and is the chief
shareholder in all the other entities.
All Group Companies have their own
independent Boards of Directors,
governance structure and policies which
align with those of M&M. Companies
who have not formulated their individual
policies also follow M&M policies.

Board of Directors
The vast experience and varied
accomplishments that our Board members
coming from diverse fields bring to the
table, paves the way for a robust structure
that guides M&M's actions and operations
to maximise stakeholder's interests with
integrity and responsibility.

The CGC comprises four members
of the Group Executive Board, who
represent business sectors as well
as the Corporate Centre. The CGC
reports to the Board of Directors.
In order to see that the Codes of
Conduct are well understood and
practised within the organisation,
a formal mechanism has been put
in place in the form of 'Corporate
Governance Coordinators' at the
business level and 'Corporate
Governance Officers' at the
plant level.

Change is imminent. On the one hand is the rapid pace with which we
are growing and on the other, is the fast evolving business

An all-inclusive structure, the
new CoC, enables effective
stakeholder engagement,
faster & fairer decisions,
transparent & unambiguous
processes, and a professional

It underlines our
responsibilities to our people,
partners and shareholders as

POLICIES

COMPLIANCE

Our policies are outcomes of our commitment to our
core values and guide us in our day-to-day operations
and help in governance. They continuously evolve with
prevailing regulations and by interactions with
stakeholders.

As we keep raising our bar on corporate governance,
compliance is a non-negotiable must. Our compliance
committee ensures that all regulations are respected
in letter and spirit. Being a global Company, we abide
by all international and national laws, and uphold the
standards of transparency and accountability.

Specific matters are addressed in detail in the
extensive Corporate Governance Policies of M&M
Limited. Though these policies are not explicitly
instituted across the entire Mahindra Group, it is an
unstated decorum for all Group Companies to follow
them in letter and spirit.
The Mahindra Group's governance policies include:
Corporate Communications | Disaster Management
Employee Relations | Environment and Pollution
Capital Budgeting | Corporate Finance | Quality
Corporate Representation in Trade & Industry Forums
Dealing with Dealers and Customers
E-business Security | Insider Trading | Intranet Usage
Investor Grievances | Investor Relations
Safety & Occupational Health | Human Resources
Sexual Harassment | Trade Marks
Suppliers and Vendors of Services & Products
Green IT Guidelines | Green Supply Chain Management

Business Responsibility Policy
We abide by an all-embracing Business Responsibility
policy incorporating economic, social and environmental
accountabilities of business as approved by our CSR
Committee Board. It is formulated in alignment with
the nine principles of Business Responsibility, required
by SEBI as per clause 55 of the Listing Agreement.

Anti-corruption Policies and Procedures
At M&M, any act of corruption is non-negotiable and
strict action is taken against anyone found indulging in
such unprincipled act. Corporate Governance & Business
Ethics are an essential part of our induction process
and an integral part of our Code of Conduct. All
employees are expected to exhibit the highest level of
integrity in every sphere of activity.

'what sustainability means to
Mahindra' by institutionalising
a sustainability house which well
captures our approach towards
the triple bottom line.

Sustainability is a complex pursuit. An interconnected web of
challenges with varying shades of intensity. The solution for
this triple bottom line construct cannot be sought in a straightjacketed fashion and calls for a systemic change. This is only
possible by challenging the status quo, continuously.
At Mahindra, Alternative Thinking has empowered
us to evolve in every aspect, every year. Over
the years, we have institutionalised
sustainability not just at the
corporate level, but at the
level of each business.

This year, we have adopted a new school of alternative thinking
by 'positively disrupting' the dominant sustainability narrative.
With conservation becoming a way of life at Mahindra, the
ambition now is to make a much larger contribution to the
resource challenge. We have, therefore, shifted our focus on
rejuvenation of resources. In contrast to conservation
which was a demand reduction paradigm,
rejuvenation is a supply enhancement
strategy. Slowly but surely, we are
bending the linearity, one
resource at a time, to
create a circularity.

Materiality is a fundamental principle
of our sustainability approach. A
mirror that reflects global emerging
issues, evolving stakeholder
expectations as well as pressing
areas that have a high-impact on our
business, our stakeholders as well as
the environment.

We conduct this exercise on a
periodic basis to stay abreast
with the changing scenarios –
economical, ecological and social.
We have also continually
enhanced the breadth and depth
of our analysis to sharpen our
materiality identification process.

In the reporting year, we underwent a
structured exercise to refresh, refine and
redefine our sustainability focus. A stepby-step approach was followed starting
with a detailed stakeholder engagement
exercise, followed with a comprehensive
materiality analysis and dovetailing the
insights to upgrade M&M's roadmap.

Materiality assessment acts
as an eﬀicient tool to introspect
on our sustainability journey
as well as shape our future plan
across the triple bottom line.

Stakeholder
Engagement
Mechanism

Depending on the need and nature of each stakeholder,
varied engagement mediums were adopted ranging from
one-to-one interactions, telephonic interviews, online
survey and email exchange. To ferret the issues in order of
priority, the stakeholders were requested to state their
material issues on a 3-point scale high, medium, and low.

Over and above
engaging to deﬁne
materiality, we
continue to interact
with our stakeholders
around the year,
through a host
of channels.

Dining with the

Diplomats

Employees

At Mahindra, our employees
are our partners in progress.

In the reporting year, we hosted the ambassadors
and senior diplomats representing 25 countries
from Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and
North America (US and Canada). Each of our
businesses were represented by our resident
managers who well interacted with the diplomats.

Engaged employees bestowed with a sense of ownership work on behalf of the organisation's
goals. They are also likely to be more productive, satisfied and motivated towards work.
A two-way dialogue with our employees, hence, happens most naturally at our units. While we
share the organisation's vision, mission, culture, and business roadmap with enthusiasm, we
also listen to their expectations and personal objectives with open ears.

and departments and create leaders across hierarchies and businesses.

The Mahindra Group has developed a two-tier HR management
approach - one at the Group level and other at the Business Level.
While the Group HR provides thought leadership and brings in
appropriate tools and methodologies, the Business Level HR ensures alignment with Group HR policies
and institutionalises customised employee initiatives for the respective business.
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. is one such business unit of the Group.

In 2011, Mahindra Swaraj embarked on a unique experiment of
diversifying its work environment to allow more women to work
on its shop floor. This gave many women an opportunity to be
part of and excel in a previously male-dominated work scenario.

This has been a life-changing initiative for one of our employees
Ramandeep Kaur. Hailing from Haryana, this daughter of a junior engineer
working with Haryana Roadways, has two younger brothers who are still
studying. At the age of 23, she was among 25 girls who found themselves
working on a predominantly male dominated shop floor.

In order to ensure that the process went off smoothly, for everyone concerned,
a number of initiatives and process changes were introduced.
Intensive training,
including dexterity
training to help
sensitise the girls
on the various
aspects of their
new environment

Gender
sensitisation
programme for
both the girls
as well as the
men on the
shop floor

Sessions with a
psychologist to
encourage the girls to
speak up in case of any
discomfort and stationing
of a counsellor trained in
industrial psychology

Appointment of a lady in
the Employee Relations
team to interface with
the girls and also to
understand their
concerns through regular
Focus Group Discussions

Customised safety
helmets and gloves
keeping in mind the
smaller build of the
ladies. Provision of
special ladies' restrooms
on the shop floor

The plant management soon noticed their potential and began including them in Quality Circle or QC
meetings which saw them congregate with other workers to identify, analyse and solve work-related
problems. Over the years, the team has taken part in and has won a number of QC competition at
intra-plant, zonal as well as national level.

49

In November 2015, Ramandeep and her
team went to Sri Lanka to participate in
the International Convention for Quality
Control Circles (ICQCC), which saw QC
teams from across the world compete
with each other. More than

a hundred teams from
over 15 countries participated
and Ramandeep's team

Mahindra Institute of Quality was established in 2006 with the objective of
developing high calibre professional managers, by facilitating latest knowledge and
skills to achieve organisation-wide excellence. Over the years, MIQ, a part of corporate
centre, M&M Ltd., has developed a portfolio of training programmes to meet quality
management requirements of companies; both within and outside Mahindra Group.

KEY LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES
Our commitment to care for our employees is evident right from the shop floor to the
top floor. In the reporting year too, several new and ongoing development programmes
were conducted for fresh, budding and experienced talent.
Elaborated below are a select few:

Group Management Cadre (GMC) Programme
Mahindra Group's prestigious strategic leadership development programme for campus
recruits sourced from top B-Schools of India,

the GMC continues to strengthen Mahindra's position as an
'Employer of Choice' across premier B-School campuses,
and create a strong talent pool to drive Mahindra's future growth.

In FY 2015-16, a total of 33 GMCs joined
the Mahindra Group across its various
sectors in different functions.
All these GMCs underwent a
detailed one-month long
induction, that comprised business
leaders speaking to them on
organisational values, strategies
and financial aspects of the
business, visits across Mahindra
plants, shop-floors and resorts, and
also a rural stint, to help the GMCs
understand more about the
livelihoods and challenges faced
by rural India.

the prestigious Employers
Federation of India's (EFI)
'Strong Commitment to

commitment to employee
relations across the nation.

We have a plethora of programmes to engage with our people.
Our new and continual engagement platforms include:

Founder's Day Celebrated in Sustainable Way
The 70th Founder's Day was celebrated on October 02, 2015
by the Automotive and Farm Equipment Sectors by putting
up sustainability stalls at AD Nashik Plant 2 on the theme of
'Save Water'. The stalls demonstrated green building
concept and importance of water conservation.
The celebration included skits on water scarcity performed
by the team members, poster competition for families, and
tree plantation drive, which was well-received and
appreciated by the participants. More than 32,000
employees and family members from 14 locations of M&M
participated in the sustainability engagement competitions.
An independent jury selected the winners.

Boosting Fun Quotient at Work
At Mahindra, fun at work is an integral part of our work ethos. This year we
conducted recreational activities on regular basis, celebrated Friendship Day,
Teacher's Day, organised Corporate Cricket Championship, and rewarded talents
with Excellarator Awards at the AD Nashik Plant 2. Through such activities, we
ensure that the fun quotient within our workspace remains intact.

We have maintained

100%
health check-up compliance

forward. Some of the health and wellness activities
undertaken during the year were:

Stepathlon | Zumba | Yoga | Powerwalk

POLICIES

Our HR policies resonate with our people management
practice. We have a well-structured framework in place to
ensure harmonious implementation of policies through a
central HR council, comprising business sector HR heads,
who address all matters related to labour practices.
As a part of Mahindra Group, M&M Ltd. ensures effective
implementation of the following policies:

Human Resource Policy | Employee Relations Policy
Minimum Notice Period of Operational Changes
Parental Leave Policy

Human Resource Policy

Employee Relations Policy

Minimum Notice Period of Operational Changes

Our HR policy aims to ensure equal dignity and equal
opportunities for all employees by aiding in:

All our employee relation policy is aimed at fulfilling the
following objectives:

• Resource planning by mappings skills and opportunities
of our employees leading to enhanced job satisfaction

• Achieve organisational goals with active involvement
of employees

During the reporting period, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.
followed all pertinent regulations in letter and intent while
employing unionised labour.

• Setting high standards of employee behaviour
and ensuring dignity of each employee irrelevant
of seniority or hierarchy

• Focus on attracting, retaining and nurturing people
with relevant skill-sets and competencies

• Garnering valuable employee feedback through
robust employee relations initiatives and periodic
employee surveys

One such regulation is The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which
applies to labour relations. It specifically mentions a threeweek notice period for all operational changes. It provides
consultation and negotiation opportunities during the notice
period. If consent is given, only then can the agreement be
signed to reflect the changes.

• Create a mutually beneficial and productive
industrial climate
• Manage employees fairly and transparently

Parental Leave Policy
When it comes to offering parental leave, we abide to best
practices and have had a good retention track record so far.
Women are encouraged to take time out to tend to their
bundle of joy and join back the workplace.

Policies govern practices, & practices help in evolving policies.

HIGHEST SAFETY

STANDARDS
At Mahindra, we lay utmost emphasis on safe working
conditions for our employees. Our rigorous safety
procedures are constantly upgraded every year, in
tandem with our technological advancement.
Despite our ardent endeavours, there are few instances
of unfortunate incidents of fatalities and accidents. This
year, 1 such fatality at AD Zaheerabad took place, which
has made us all the more vigilant.

Zero-injury or zero-accident, though difficult
goal to achieve, can only be possible if best
practices are widely shared and ingrained in
each team member.

Safety Focus
We are committed to avoid unsafe incidents through
adoptions of key safety tools and practices:

The Plant 1 at AD Nashik was commissioned in 1981. Today more than 5,000
workers and employees manufacture around 220,000 vehicles per year. The
plant has a cross-functional sustainability team, headed by a Mahindra
Sustainability Champion and a CSAP-CII certified sustainability assessor. All
the team members are GRI G4 competent. A safety office is part of this team.
Training and awareness are two of our most important tools for establishing a
culture of safety. Our online platforms like e-Portal covers 100% of our officers
and helps us identify the training need gaps and address them efficiently.
We conduct training sessions on welding, assembly, paint shop, contract work,
central safety, defensive driving and firefighting to name a few. The key
highlights this year was Waste Management and Online Training Module, which
was executed through Training Gurukuls.

Key Health & Safety Initiatives
We have a number of initiatives in
place to ensure that safety is
prioritised, practiced and reinforced
on a regular basis. Some of the
major initiatives undertaken during
the year include:

Will Training Initiatives | Across FD

Health Index | Auto & Farm Sectors
A medical software was also
successfully launched across M&M
in FY 2015-16, to systematically
analyse the health check-up
findings, low fat and health index
data. This shall help plant doctors
plan necessary interventions to
improve employee health as well
as measure its effectiveness.

Skill & Capability Building is one of the
strategic priorities of the Employee
Relations & Development team at every
Production Unit (PU) of Farm Division. This
capability building includes personal as
well as organisational capabilities.
Because we believe that skill excellence
stems from a combination of Skill and
Will; where Skill includes technical and
quality aptitudes while Will includes
behavioural and organisational conduct.

Safety training constitutes an
important aspect of the Will
Building in every FD plant's
annual training plan. During
the reporting period, various
FD plants undertook seminars
on topics like lifestyle
disorders, dietary advice and
yoga, and training workshops
on disaster management, first
aid and firefighting.

All permanent workers and officers of M&M
undergo periodic health check-up as per the health
and wellness policy. Every employee's health is
assessed on the basis of a Unique Health Index,
consisting of various blood parameters as well as
lifestyle factors such as frequency of exercise, junk
food consumption and tobacco usage.

Embedding Safety in Design | FD Zaheerabad
Farm Division's Zaheerabad plant was commissioned in 2012 with the aim of catering
to the large farming sector in South India. This plant is spread across approximately
100 acres and has the installed capacity of 100,000 tractors per annum.

Safety Curtain Sensor

AD Haridwar

Being a new-age plant, it has been designed keeping in mind
the Production, Quality, Cost, Delivery, Safety, Morale (PQCDSM)
benchmarks of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM).

Here are some of the safety aspects that have been addressed at the
Zaheerabad plant:

Built-in Safety Poka-Yoke's during design & planning stage
Water sprinkler system in entire plant
Fire hydrant system inside the assembly building
Ergonomically designed work stations
Built-in Jishu Hozen (Autonomous Maintenance) concepts

In September 2015, the
Haridwar plant, M&M
Ltd.'s sole automotive
plant in North India,
achieved a production
milestone of 700,000
vehicles. It achieved this
feat in less than 10 years
of commissioning. In fact,
for the past two years,
the plant has earned the
distinction of having one
of the highest production
capacities amongst other
automotive plants of
Mahindra.

This achievement of manufacturing
excellence is a result of the commitment of
our workforce. And this commitment can only
be reinforced by providing our workers with
world-class safety systems. One such

system introduced this year was the
Safety Curtain Sensors in the press
machines to prevent hand injury to
the workmen.
In any automotive plant, the hydraulic press
performs a wide range of functions; from
injection moulding of plastic bumpers to the
hydroforming of chassis components. The
presses can range from 5 to 100,000 ton or
more and can operate at blinding speeds,
leaving no time for operators to move their
hand or body out of the way should a cycle
be accidentally started.

The safety curtain is an electro-sensitive optical
safety device used to protect people working near
such press machines. When the light curtain
senses entry into the protected zone by an object,
it sends a stop signal to the guarded machine.

During the year, there was one
unfortunate case of fatality as a
result of electrocution due to
inappropriate handling of a live
welding torch at the AD Zaheerabad
plant. A comprehensive root-causeanalysis of the incidence was
conducted based on which the
following corrective and preventive
measures were devised:

Leather forearm sleeves implemented for all the
welders in the plant
Electric resistant (Fibre toe) safety shoe extended
to all welders
Residual Current Breaker with Over-Current
Protection (RCBO) of 30 milliamps implemented for
all welding machines and ensured its working

Mahindra is geared and committed to develop smart mobility for the 21st
century. All our mobility products, existing or new, are regularly put under
the scanner and need to pass the 5C test:

Clean, Convenient,
Connected, Clever
& Cost Eﬀective.

By constantly reinventing our

more fuel-efficient, roadfriendly and humanfriendly, we give shape
and form to our belief of
leveraging 'continuous
improvement' as a key
plank and taking
sustainable mobility
to the last mile.

The future is automatic
XUV5OO and Scorpio
Cars with automatic
transmission are easier
to learn and more
comfortable to drive,
especially in traffic. They
are also better at
managing power and
handling gear ratios.
Keeping these benefits
in mind, we introduced
automatic transmission
in the new-generation
XUV5OO and Scorpio.
NEW-GEN SCORPIO
The Mahindra Scorpio
AT pairs a 6-speed
automatic transmission
to the 2.2-liter, fuelefficient mHawk fourcylinder diesel engine.

XUV5OO
The New Age XUV5OO is
the only SUV in its class to
offer a 2nd generation 6speed automatic
transmission mated to the
2.2 litre mHawk engine
with All Wheel Drive (AWD)
as an option. It has a
higher number of gear
ratios than a conventional
5 speed automatic which
enables the driveline to
deliver the best fuel
efficiency. The New Age
XUV 5OO is also powered
by a micro hybrid
technology that
intelligently switches off
the engine when not
required. This makes the
new XUV5OO extremely
fuel efficient with a
mileage of 16 km/l (ARAI
certified).

Being green, e cient and clean
does not mean that the mileage or
distance is compromised. The
lithium-ion batteries used in the
e2o give you a distance of 120 kms
or more in one full charge.

The India's farmers have still not boarded the
mechanised farming bandwagon largely due the
high cost of entrance. The farming sector still
largely consists of small farms that either don't
have the necessary capital or don't see the
return on investment in mechanisation. To
capitalise on this opportunity, our Farm Division
forayed into agriculture equipment rental
services with the launch of Trringo, India's
foremost organised rental service.

9 lakh

Self Help Groups (SHGs)

Trringo is a first-of-its-kind technology driven model in the tractor rental business
for those farmers who may not afford their own tractor and equipment. The service
will operate on a dual business model.
The first model is one where the franchisee
will invest in tractors and equipment to rent
it out and set up a hub for operations. Trringo
will use proprietary digital platform as an
enabler to process orders and pass them to
the nearest Franchisee through location
based mapping. It will also provide service
through a dedicated app and a toll-free
number. The franchisee could also tie-up with
tractor owners in the vicinity enabling them
to rent out equipment to farmers on a
commission basis.

In the second C2C business model, large farmers who own expensive, highend equipment can rent out their assets thereby optimising utilisation based
on seasonality, even cutting across geographies. TRRINGO would connect the
asset owner to the user using the App and by virtue of creating a national
brand awareness.

The initiative will drive mechanisation of the
agricultural sector, enabling small farmers to
access technology that can boost their yields
and thereby overall farm prosperity.
More power in the farmer's hand
SWARAJ 960 FE with POWER MAX 60 Engine
Farmers can now haul heavier loads and complete more
field work at a faster rate and in lesser time, thereby
boosting farm productivity. Our Swaraj brand marked its
entry into the highly competitive 60 horsepower (hp) tractor
category, with the launch of the new Swaraj 960 FE.
The 960 FE offers additional power to farmers, especially for
haulage and other heavy applications. It features a 3,478 cc,
three-cylinder engine which is the largest in the category
and has also been fitted with a constant mesh gear box,
allowing its owner to work for longer hours without fatigue.
Apart from more torque and the highest cc, it also offers
better fuel economy.

These SHGs have been organised
into Farmer Producer Companies
(FPCs). Mahindra Samriddhi, over
the next few months, will develop
a plan to work in select
geographies with the aim of
providing Samriddhi products and
services to these FPCs and explore
possibilities to buy back pulses

Stimulating farm prosperity | Jingo
Jingo is a unique agricultural bio-stimulant
product made indigenously from natural extracts
that will help plants in producing maximum yields.

This product conforms to the
sustainable Nutricycling mechanism,
and is thus an eco-friendly and toxin-free.
When JINGO is sprayed on plants, it elevates plant
hormone synthesis, increases photosynthetic
efficiency, accelerates cell multiplication and
enhances carbon and nitrogen utilisation. The
precise action of JINGO on plants leads to root
mass proliferation, shoot length increase and
early growth vigour, which directly translates to
increase in crop yield.

Towards Farm-Tech Prosperity
Grape Poly Guard
Grape growers in India are facing a lot of
problems due to unfavourable climatic
changes like unseasonal rainfall, hail
storms and heavy winds. These not only
reduce the quality and yield but also
increase the propensity of pests. Keeping
in mind the vision of Farm Tech Prosperity,
EPC Mahindra worked closely with farmers
and developed the Grape Poly Guard.
Grape Poly Guard is a protective covering
of poly sheet over the grape orchard
which provides protection to the grape
vines against unseasonal rains, hail
storms and wind. While it allows uniform
diffusion of light over the vine to enhance
proper photosynthesis, it has UV
resistance ability that protects the crop
from high temperatures. The Poly Guard
also maintains the Downey and Powdery
Mildew diseases below the economical
threshold level.

In the last few years, governments
across the world have started giving a
fresh look at their regulatory
frameworks. This has made compliance
more difficult to achieve as well as
sustain. In such a scenario, we take
pride in the fact that our internal
benchmarks for quality have always
been a notch above the prevailing
regulations of that era.

FY 2015-16 reflected on the impacts of two
consecutive droughts. But despite such an
unfavourable climate in the homeland and an
extremely volatile global operational
environment, the Indian economy continued
to show signs of recovery throughout the
year. This is impressive and bears testimony
to the policy repair that has been wrought
since the near crisis experienced in May 2013.

The growth momentum, however, remained
disappointingly modest through most of the
year. With external demand remaining
sluggish, rural incomes battered by four
consecutively weak cropping seasons and
domestic private investments constrained by
excess capacities and rising balance sheet
stress, urban consumption and public capital
expenditures were virtually the only sources
of demand that picked up pace this fiscal.

However, even amidst this scenario, Mahindra
& Mahindra recorded an increase of 6.23% in
net income at INR 417.4 billion in the year
under review as against INR 392.9 billion in
the previous year. While this growth rate has
brought a spring in our steps, what's lent us a
shot in the arm is the addition of 11 new
products in our portfolio. These product
launches were across product categories and
have helped strengthen M&M's presence
across industry segments.
Auto Division maintained leadership status in
the domestic UV market by posting a market
share of 37.9% with 7.5% rise in sales volume.
Farm Division (including Swaraj Division)
recorded sales of 214,173 tractors as against
234,766 tractors sold in the previous year,
recording a decline of 8.8%. This slowdown is
an outcome of a dip in the demand of tractors
- the Indian tractor industry declined by 10.4%
in FY 2015-16. Beyond tractors, the focus
remained on offering crop care solutions to
improve farm prosperity. This business saw a
growth of 13.3% in terms of revenue this year.

In the reporting years, M&M presented
the future of mobility solutions in the form of multiple launches:
We unveiled an all-electric sports performance car
'e2o sport' at the Auto Expo 2016. The car is a
manifestation of Mahindra's leadership in the electric
vehicle category in India. It brings together an
unbeatable range of 200km with supreme
performance of an 80 KW power train. Some unique
features of e2o sports are its instant acceleration of
0-60kmph in 4 seconds (0-100 kmph in 8 seconds)
and 384V – high voltage power pack.

The Supro Electric Van is an 8-seater zero-emission mini-van
powered by advanced lithium-ion batteries. Capable of covering
a distance of 100 kms on a single charge, the Supro Electric Van is
fully-automatic and can hit an electronically limited top-speed of 50
kilometers per hour. The Supro Electric Van can be a preferred option for
first and last mile connectivity for Metro rail and BRTS systems, school vans,
corporate employee commuting solutions and can further serve the purpose
of campus commuting.

I see electric mobility becoming the
norm, even in India. It's not far in the
future that electric vehicles will share our
roads with more conventional products.
At Mahindra, we intend to accelerate that
transformation.”

The Mahindra Racing Formula E Team made
its debut in March at the Miami ePrix. The
Mahindra Group also had its first joint event
in the US around this race to showcase its
growing expertise in Electric Vehicle
technology both with their Formula E racing
cars and the GenZe electric two wheeler.

eVerito, our new electric sedan is a 100%
zero emission, green vehicle. An automatic
transmission sedan, it can be charged at
home and can also be quick charged in 2 hours
through fast charging. In one charge, Mahindra
eVerito can travel for up to 100 kms based on vehicle
loading and can achieve a top speed of 86 kmph.

and global economic growth will be
cut by 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030,

if the world fails to tackle climate change.”

While we expand our presence in the global market, our intention to retain local operations and sourcing
remains steadfast. As a corporate citizen of India, our sphere of local sourcing envelops the length and
breadth of the country. However, some businesses have their own definition and boundary of what
constitutes as local. This depends on the nature of operation, industry requirements and other on-ground
realities like access to technology and know-how, tax and duty regimes and supply of skilled manpower.
But in any of the two scenarios, we demand from our suppliers uncompromised quality standards.
Some of the parameters which enable us to identify and empanel our suppliers include:
Performance and On-time Delivery | Compliance on Environment, Health and Safety Guidelines
Corporate Policy | Commitment to Reduce the Carbon Footprint | Statutory Requirements | Costs

Every manmade construct is
a consequence of natural
resources. It is hence only
natural for the effects of
climate change to disrupt our
life as usual - economic,
social as well as existential.
Our businesses cover both
manufacturing and
agricultural sectors, and
are hence even more
susceptible to
temperamental weathers
and changing climates.
Restricted access to raw
materials like water, rising
energy costs, changing
consumer preferences - the
implications of climate
change pose alarming
challenges to the
sustainability of our business.

But while all these factors
can sedate operational
productivity and dampen
investor confidence, they can
also act as perfect enablers
of competitiveness if thought
alternatively.

At Mahindra, we have been doing just the same – turning financial challenges into financial
opportunities. Our sustainability journey started by transforming our processes into energy
saving and emission reducing agents. Over the years, we have now moved on from
'conservation of resources' to 'rejuvenation of resources' approach by further investing in
clean and renewable energy. Following are some of ways in which we keep a sharp focus to
address climate change:
Participate in diverse
national and international
climate change think tanks
In the reporting year, Mr. Anand
Mahindra was invited as the sole
representative of the corporate
world at the historic Paris Climate
Change Agreement Signing
Ceremony. Additionally, M&M
became the 1st Indian Company to
join EP100, a global energy
commitment to double their energy
productivity by 2030.

Continual energy efficiency
through process efficiency
M&M's absolute GHG emissions, both
Scope 1 & 2, reduced in the reporting year.
Our businesses reduced emissions by 10,883 tCO2
as a result of our ongoing conservation
endeavours.
Investment in clean power
Green energy is clean energy. Plus, alternative
energy sources like solar, wind and thermal also
offer an additional input to our power needs. As
of now, 7% of power mix consists of renewables
and we are in pursuit to give clean energy a
greater share in our power mix.

Systemic Intervention to embed
sustainability in supply chain
We mentor our suppliers on climate risk and
sustainable practices. This year, we developed
a green supply chain management system to
streamline the environment accountability of
suppliers of Auto & Farm divisions which will go
a long way in optimising use of natural resources
as well reduce emissions.

COMPREHENSIVE DISCLOSURES

The teams across all our units possess the
enthusiasm and the wherewithal to drive
efficiencies in all environment aspects such as
energy, waste, water and biodiversity. A wellstructured process ensures comprehensive
interventions, right from creating awareness
about conservation to managing resources
through on-ground actions.

Our environment roadmap is aligned with emerging scenarios and
stakeholder expectations which are reflected in our efforts. Our
interventions strategically focus on KPIs material to our business:

Carbon Neutrality

Water Positivity & Water Security
reduced water use, recycling and water harvesting

Robust monitoring practices like environmental
impact assessment enables us to continuously
improve, thereby not just outperform our own
targets but also be ahead of the industry curve
on environment KPIs.

Zero Waste & Circular Economy

Sustainability reporting contributes to our
sustainability agenda in more ways than one.
Disclosures result in deliberations and while we
report, we also reflect on our performance and
realign our efforts with evolving expectations.

supply chain, therefore, is a key
generator of business value for
M&M. We proactively engage
with our suppliers and vendors
to incorporate environmentfriendly practices beyond our
factory gates and encourage
them to adopt green initiatives.
In the reporting period, many of
our suppliers took steps
enhancing their green cover,
saving the precious resource
through rainwater harvesting
and conserving electricity
through operational efficiency.

As part of the optimisation process, capacity
enhancement for Non Stop Tuning (NST) Hoods
was taken up by our logistics partner resulting
in doubled carrying capacity. Earlier only 20 sets
of hoods per truck were carried, now 40 sets of

BIODIVERSITY

The Never-ending Journey called Afforestation
Project Hariyali Snapshot
In 2007, the Mahindra Group set an ambitious goal of planting
1 million trees every year across the nation to increase India's
green cover and offset national greenhouse gas emissions. So
far 9.2 million trees have been planted pan India. M&M has been
actively contributing to this Group-wide afforestation movement
since its inceptions and has marked a plantation score of

2,332,496
trees till date (2007-2016)

During the reporting period, we planted 111,430 trees through
the combined efforts of our employees and community partners.
M&M has been actively working in the direction of
conserving biodiversity for the past several years. Last
year, we signed the India Business & Biodiversity Initiative
(IBBI) to raise awareness and enhance capacity on
preserving the natural capital. As part of the same, we have
undertaken assessment of impacts and dependencies on
biodiversity across our entire value chain and developed
strategies to rich ecosystem.

Biodiversity is the quintessence of life.
The rich fauna and ﬂora, the forests, the water bodies are absolute essentials for human wellbeing,
climate stability and socio-economic growth.

In the reporting period, Mahindra & Mahindra reported its performance
against the 10-point declaration of IBBI. Following are the 10-points on
which M&M's performance was tested and outcomes shared.

Mapping biodiversity interfaces
with business operations
Enhancing awareness on
biodiversity within the organisation
Assessing biodiversity risks
and opportunities
Considering the impacts of
business decisions on biodiversity
Setting objectives and targets
for biodiversity management
Designating an individual within
the organisation as biodiversity

Botanical Garden for School Children
A barren plot of 7.5 acres was converted into a green
zone by planting more than 10,000 trees and 130
different varieties of medicinal and botanical species.
Named Mahindra Hariyali Botanical garden, it has so far
attracted 21,850 students from 337 schools and colleges.

Creating Biodiversity Awareness
To create awareness on biodiversity among the locals,
we published a pictorial guide book on various species of
Nandur Madhameshwar Bird Sanctury in Marathi.

Adopting Borgad Hill.
Transforming it into a Green Paradise
Borgad Hill, situated in the east Nashik forest division, had become
barren due to rampant deforestation, following which, the state
government declared the region as a conservation reserve forest in
2007. With an objective to rejuvenate the area's biodiversity, we adopted
Borgad Hill and tied up with NSCN to launch the greening effort. The
project's aim was to plant 50,000 saplings on the hill. Beginning 2007,
Neem, Mango, Sitaphal, Amla, Jatropha and Badam plants were trucked
over from nurseries and from the forest department. It took nearly 18
months to complete the tree-planting exercise. While M&M bankrolled
the whole project, NSCN supervised its execution.
The region's bio-diversity has improved vastly. Birds such as the spotted
dove, paradise flycatcher, blue flycatcher, Malabar whistling-thrush,
eagle and blackbird have once again made the forested area their home.
As have butterflies, reptiles and a variety of animals, including
hyena, jungle cats, porcupine and mongoose.

Including the applicable biodiversity
aspects in the environmental
management systems
Encouraging relevant stakeholders to
support better biodiversity management
Engaging in policy advocacy and
dialogue with Government, NGOs and

The results are there for all to see today:
Borgad is being transformed into becoming

Nourishing the Igatpuri Plant Area
Water scarcity and deforestation in Igatpuri region was directly affecting the biodiversity in the area. With the objective of
rejuvenating the area and enhancing biodiversity, we surveyed the Igatpuri plant and found that 22 acre of open land is
available and can be transformed into a green cover. We zeroed-in setting up a biodiversity park on this land and in the initial
phase following activities were flagged-off:

Despite scientific advances in renewable sources, factors like economic
viability and geographic specificity have long hampered the promotion

of alternative energy sources. Hence from a pragmatic viewpoint,

energy still remains an indispensable-but-not-inexhaustible resource,
which will hinder the sustainability of a business. Add to that its impact
on the environment, which poses a direct threat to the human health.

Dependence of conventional sources
of energy, hence, must be decreased

drastically

We have already started taking actions in this direction and
our teams recorded inspiring success stories in the reporting period:

Bringing down per body power consumption conversion
from 132 units/body to 99 units/body in the paint shop
Introducing two-in-one heat pump for heating and
chilling purposes at the Zaheerabad plant
Achieved 14% reduction in power consumption as against
the targeted 10% at our Spares Unit in Bhiwandi
Interventions like these have led to decrease in our energy consumption. In the reporting period, our energy
consumption stood at 1,528,765 GJ compared to 1,530,569 GJ last year. An elaborate list of energy efficiency
initiatives undertaken in FY 2015-16 has been provided further in this section. We will continue to take these

approximately 850 KLD out of
which 300 KLD water is
supplied by MCGM and used for
processes such as cooling
towers, drinking etc. This
makes it important to

insulate the plant
from such extreme conditions.

to Avoid Water Crisis

Action

To deal with such water crises,
a special water conservation team was formed and
given a special task to insulate the plant production.

Following measures were taken up:
• Streamlined the downstream side process of existing
Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant and increase its yield by
almost 43%
• Utilisated 2ndRO plant near PT-CED on full scale
(Capacity 5 KL/hr)
• Eliminated use of municipal water which was previously
used in the café and canteen for washing utensils

Using Water

W i s e ly
CHALLENGE

The town and district of Nashik in
Maharashtra has been facing severe water
scarcity in the recent years. In light of this
situation, the consumption of water at Nashik
Plant was deemed very high. Part of the
problem lied in non-availability of a
measurement mechanism and absence of a
concerted water management mechanism.
Thus it became imperative that we manage
water more wisely in order to both reduce
consumption as well as dependence on
ground or municipality supplied water.

ACTION
A dedicated team was formed
to work on water management.
The objectives & targets for the team
and the performance was linked
to their KRAs.
Projects were identified at the start of the year and
measurement & monitoring of the initiatives were done
with a review of the team and top management.
A water policy was also formulated.

INTERVENTIONS TAKEN UP
FOR WATER MANAGEMENT

Domestic
• Designed water network as per hydrography
• Shifted all underground piping to above ground in order to identify
and address any leakage

WASTE

Case
Study

We manage waste in a socially responsible, financially viable, and
environmentally sound manner. Whatever waste we generate is
responsibly disposed keeping the compliances, rules and regulations
of the land in mind.
Hazardous waste is handed over to authorised hazardous waste
collection vendors equipped with the requisite treatment, storage
and disposal facilities, while a major portion of non-hazardous waste
is disposed through contractors who hand it over to large-scale
recycling units or reuse it. However, a lot of energy, manpower and
costs go into waste disposal.

Making the Best out of Waste
Recycling of waste helps in reducing
environmental impacts arising from its
treatment and disposal. To keep
surroundings cleaner and healthier we
decided to make the best out of the
waste from the Igatpuri plant.
• Scrap forklift tyres and engine parts
were upcycled to make furniture
such as chair and table
• Used plastic bottles were turned
into bird feeders

• Scrap metal pipes were painted and
converted in to pen stands
• Wooden scrap was made into
benches and tables

Challenge
During an average spray
painting process,
approximately 70% of the
paint goes on the body shell
while remaining 30% goes
waste. This paint sludge is
hazardous waste and needs
to be treated separately, as
per government norms. There
were two challenges:

to reduce the
formation of
waste and to
dispose it in a
cost-effective
and environmentfriendly manner.

Waste Not,
Want Not
Action

We evaluated various methods of disposal and
finally got the idea of reusing the paint sludge.
• Gunny bags were used instead of metallic containers to collect the paint sludge. The gunny
bags helped the water content to drain off from the paint sludge, leading to reduction in
weight which means less disposal cost
• Instead of disposing off the paint sludge, we recycled it by using dryer to make powder

Making the Best out of Waste
'Kagaz ke Phool' was launched at Mahindra Towers, Worli, by the Esops
and CIS teams in partnership with Greenlogix, a waste management
company. Through this programme all waste materials in the office
including papers, plastic, newspapers, magazines, bottles, and folders
were collected and recycled by Greenlogix. Further, to make the initiative
more efficient, all the office boys and housekeeping staff were educated
on the importance of waste management.

• Powder paint made from paint sludge is at par qualitatively with other powder paints.
It can be used for interior parts of vehicle

We select materials on the basis of its sustainable value. These materials
help our product to be more sustainable without affecting their efficiency
and performance. Use of innovative technology and methods in
manufacturing has helped us reduce material consumption. Of the several
initiatives we have taken to be more sustainable with our material, below
are the few ones.

Material is an important consideration for
any product to be realised. For an
automotive major like us, it comes in the
form of semi-manufactured materials,
associated materials, packaging materials
and raw material; it comes in the form of
solid as well as liquid. But eventually, every
material used in manufacturing, traces its
roots back to nature.

INITIATIVES

Innovation in Paint Sludge Reduction

This makes it susceptible to becoming
a scarce commodity in the future, if not

With the objective of bringing in innovative technology to reduce paint sludge,
initiatives such as electrostatic gun which allows the paint to "wrap" around
the product being sprayed, and use of robotic painting were taken up at
Nashik Plant 1.

PACKAGING

To develop packaging which meets
the objective of sustainability and yet
performs the tasks for which it is
required, is a challenge. M&M has
taken several steps to weed out any
negative environmental impact of
packaging from our products. In last
few years, we have considerably
reduced our consumption of nonrecyclable material to make the
packaging of our products convenient,
economic, and environmental friendly.

INITIATIVE

Packaging Improvements
at Nashik Plant 1
Earlier, the AD Nashik plant 1
depended a lot on corrugated and
wooden boxes for packaging. Not only
did this use more wood and other
natural resources, but also had some
inherent problems like seepage of
moisture, etc.
Following packaging improvements
were introduced during the year:
• Replaced corrugated boxes with
plastic packaging, returnable PP
Pallets, and returnable PP boxes as
per the category of the product
• Used trolleys wherever packaging
material was not necessary for
intra-plant transfers
• Used Mesh pallets instead of
wooden boxes
• Introduced Baling machines were
for compacting the material and
reducing the number of trips required
• Eliminated the use of thermocol
fully in packaging

Case
Study

Green Packaging
Initiatives at FD
Challenge

The FD plants used to consume over 700 tonnes of wooden boxes and over 2,300
tonnes of corrugated boxes for packaging and transporting parts; both within and
outside the plants. In addition to consuming precious wood, such packaging also
had problems like higher likelihood of rejection due to breakage, seepage of
moisture during monsoon and non-reusability.

Action

Green packaging is an important constituent of
the Green Supply Chain Policy adopted by the
Auto & Farm Sectors.

COMPLIANCE

The best way to handle a spill is to prevent it. Spill preventions
needs preparedness and continuous improvement in every
phase of operation. At M&M Ltd., we are committed to ensure
complete safety of our operations and the environment
through a comprehensive environment management system,
which also encompasses spills. During the reporting period, we
did not record any significant incidents of spills.

Compliance is not just a business requirement; it is a top
business priority at M&M Ltd. We proactively keep track of
the compliance throughout the year using internal audits
and address the issues as they arise. We adhere to
environmental compliances and abide by all the applicable
laws of the land for all of our projects. During the reporting
period, we were not fined for any non-compliance.

Case
Study
Challenge
Commitment is a significant but
not a sufficient factor towards
ushering in positive change.
While we have been engaging
with our suppliers for adopting
sustainable practices, a
constructive engagement couple
with comprehensive action plan
was the need of the hour.

A Systemic Intervention

Towards Greening Our Supply Chain
Action
We zeroed in on certain environment aspects most crucial for their as well as our business:

Conserving Natural Resources | Minimising Waste
Reducing Incidents of Pollution & Occupational Health

• Monitored packaging improvement projects through a 19-step methodology

A green supply chain management system was developed for streamlining environment
accountability of suppliers of Auto & Farm divisions. Below improvements were identified
and actualised:

• Visited supplier sites for developing confidence in sustainable packaging implementation

• Replaced corrugated boxes with returnable PP box

• Developed packaging SOP and calculation sheet for project feasibility

• Reduced transportation by combining various suppliers

• Revamped design for some component to achieve both sustainability and quality

• Cut the number of trucks for long distance by keeping parts within the body shell
rather than sending it separately

In the reporting period, the Farm Division initiated the packaging journey with the following:

The FD team identified 340 small and large suppliers of packaging materials and during
the reporting period, it collaborated with 28 of them to find greener and better ways to
package. Following are some of the major results:
• The lamps and mirrors which were
earlier transported as 4 pieces per
box in corrugated boxes, are now
packaged as 6 pieces per box in
returnable PP boxes

• The sheet metal for H1 Fuel Tanks used to be
packaged in 7 ply corrugated boxes. This
consumed over 200 Tonnes of wood every year
and also enhanced the likelihood of damage to
the metal during manual handling. Moreover,
the card boxes were prone to moisture
• Fuel tanks were earlier packaged in
seepage during monsoons and as a result over
corrugated boxes that showed 7%
8% of the boxes used to get rejected. Today,
rejection during FY 2014-15 itself.
PP boxes with internal cushioning material are
This year, PP boxes with metal
used for packaging which protects the inside
stands were used to package the
material during transit. They are water proof,
tanks and there has been 0%
reusable and come with 0% rejection. This also
rejection ever since
resulted in annual saving of ₹3.4 million.
• BP hoods were transported in
cardboard boxes, resulting in 15%
rejection during FY 2014-15. Now
they are being transported in
specially designed metal stands
which allows two parts to be
packaged together using the
nesting doll concept.

123

SPILLS

• One more important packaging concept
introduced during the year was that of
merging and combining of parts like CCF
covers and brake drums. Now, because of the
direct line feeding, no requirement for opening
and emptying the corrugated boxes and
completing the binning, the DOL has improved
and wood consumption of 22 Tonnes has
been saved.

• Localised suppliers leading to reduction in transportation, inventory and lead time
• Improved process efficiency by introducing automated material inwarding process
• Developed mutually beneficial relationship with the customer-supplier relationship
by providing training and appreciating them

Outcomes
Tangible benefits
• 18.63% reduction in cardboard packaging

• 62% reduction in fire load

• 31% decrease in wood packaging

• 83% improvement in material inwarding process
and ₹1.8 million reduction in manpower cost

• 1,211,000 litre savings on yearly fuel
• 3,077 ton CO2 mitigation achieved yearly

• 5% improvement in 5S score

Intangible benefits
• Reduced GHG emission (Green House Gases) • Improved supplier- customer relationship
• Enhanced moral of employees and associates

Green Supply Chain Management policy was also deployed at other Mahindra Auto & Farm division plants
including Kandivli, Igatpuri, Haridwar, Chakan & Zaheerabad. The initiative identified 65 local suppliers.

A WELCOME
CHANGE FOR
GIRL STUDENTS

Out of the 900 students studying at Mogadampalli High school 430 are
girls. However, the sanitation and hygiene facilities available are
inadequate to meet the needs of all students, especially girls. During the
need assessment phases of this project the FD Esops team discovered
that one of the factors responsible for a high dropout rate was
insufficient toilet facilities at the school. As a result, the team arranged
for necessary sanitation facilities, enabling the girls to study with dignity.

SNAPSHOTS OF
PREVIOUS PHASES

Most of the ailments that occur in rural areas are due
to lack of proper sanitation and open defecation. This
is a vexing problem in many developing countries and
India is no exception. In order to encourage private
defecation and safe disposal, our Esops teams across
various units took multiple steps.

With an objective to enhance livelihoods of farmers, M&M team with
the support of NGOs, Government departments and the villagers built a
check dam at Kalampada, Peth with storage capacity of around
3,500,000 litre. This effort will go a long way in benefitting the farmers
of the region who could cultivate only in monsoon due to unavailability
of a proper water store facility and needed to migrate to nearby cities
for alternative livelihoods the rest of the period.

A Tripartite Agreement with Naandi Foundation &
Mahindra World City Developers Ltd. was signed to
set up a biogas plant to convert food and other
waste into energy and fertilizer to be used by
the local community. Testing lab has been
set up and trials are on. Through this
initiative 300 people benefitted this year.

As part of the tree plantation drive at Araku valley,
850,000 trees were planted in the tribal belt of
the region in the reporting year. Till date, a total

1.23 million trees have been
planted in the valley.

A NEIGHBOUR IN NEED
Responding to the fire incident at the Damunagar slums of
Kandivali (E) that destroyed 1,200 homes, M&M was the first to
take steps to mitigate the disaster. Fire engines were pressed into
service to control the fire. Even after the fire was arrested, Esops
volunteers remained at the location for three days distributing
food packets and offering medical support to the affected.

ENDURING THE HEAT,
IN THE TIME OF NEED
The true measure of individuals can be gauged from how
they help others in times of challenge. Mr. Nitin Mohod, an
officer at FD, Kandivli, just proved his mettle by coming to
his neighbour's rescue when a fire broke out in a flat near
his residential complex.
On observing heavy smoke emitting from the adjacent
building, he immediately rushed to the location and
switched off the power supply, and doused the fire using
the available extinguisher. His presence of mind won him
praises and a hundred smiles.

award under 'Factory Location'
category. This recognition was
conferred for their Mahindra
Primary Health and Cancer Care
Project committed towards
addressing one of the major health
challenges in Punjab.
Cancer is closely identified with
indiscriminate use of agro-chemical
in agriculture and direct exposure
to pesticide. In order to do their bit
to combat the above situation
Esops Volunteers at Swaraj Division
initiated a stand-alone project
which takes care of the terminally
ill cancer patients and also spreads
awareness on the precautionary

Mahindra Saarthi Abhiyaan is an endeavour to promote the
education of girl children of drivers working for Mahindra Truck

carefully-selected projects, secondly to
change the sentiment around the farmers
and the agricultural sector as a whole.
Jointly driven by the Strategy team - FES

Marathwada is one of the most waterdeficient regions of Maharashtra. Three
successive years of drought have
compounded the condition of this arid area
with devastating ecological, economical as
well as socials impacts. In an effort to restore
the water table of this water-deprived region,
we chanellised our energies towards repairing
old structures as well as building new water
storage structures. 56 structures were
repaired or built in 34 villages, leading to
increased water availability for 38,357 people
during the dry season.

Rise for Safe Roads –
Zero Fatality Corridor
We signed a Zero Fatality Corridor MOU with the Maharashtra
State Road Development Corporation, in association with SAVE
Life Foundation. This initiative is our contribution to make roads
safer. To be executed over a period of 5 years, this is a first-ofits-kind project aimed to create a zero fatality corridor on the
Mumbai-Pune Expressway by training long-haul truck drivers for
safe driving. This year, 1,200 drivers were trained.

Support

Mahindra Pride School

The education of a girl child means the education of a whole new generation.
Instituted in 1996 by the K C Mahindra Education Trust in partnership with the
Naandi Foundation, Project Nanhi Kali makes primary education accessible to girls
from economically backward communities in India.

The Mahindra Pride Schools through their one-of-a-kind livelihood training
programmes continue to take forward their vision to completely
transform youth from socially and economically disadvantaged
communities by training and placing them in high-growth service
sector careers.

Nanhi Kali continues to provide educational support to underprivileged girls, thanks
to a strong collaboration with 19 NGOs. Today, it works to change the lives of little
girls in 30 districts across nine Indian states - Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh,
Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Delhi, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana.

Education builds a nation and
transforms lives. When we address
problems that plague education, we
resolve multiple issues that can uplift
society in its true sense.

In addition to facilitating the girls' academic journey, Nanhi Kali also takes care of
other requirements such as their uniforms, school bags and stationery. This
comprehensive nature of the project helps keep the dropout rates in check.

For us at Mahindra, education is a
crucial facet of our social responsibility.
Our well-designed and ablyimplemented interventions focus on
three key objectives:

Nanhi Kalis are selected based on multiple aspects such as the family income,
parents' educational portfolio, social background and the child's aptitude. The project
has a sponsorship support programme with international arms in the US and UK, to
extend its reach, and empower more girl children in India to realise their dream of
education.

E

In the financial year 2016, the project supported the education of 120,466 girls.
Of these 14,918 girls were supported by M&M while the Mahindra Group as a whole
supported 53,049 girls. The balance girls were supported by other corporates &
individuals.

Success Story

Employer Testimonials
Vikas Kumar belonged to an impoverished family
living in Chandigarh. Since his father died early,
his mother was the sole breadwinner. Though she
worked hard, as a domestic help she could only
manage a meagre wage of INR 300 in which she
had to support three children. This job too was
lost, as her health deteriorated. This forced all the
children to take up petty jobs at an early age.
After his school, he would sell snacks to add to
the marginal family income.
After his 10th standard, Vikas took a job at a call
centre with a monthly salary of INR 5,000. But he
hoped more from his life and joined Mahindra
Pride School, Chandigarh.
Vikas was initially hesitant but soon found
comfort and encouragement of his trainers. He
was exposed to a world of knowledge in
hospitality through teachers, visiting lecturers and
industry specialists. He also acquired practical
knowhow through visits to Café Coffee Day.
Well trained and equipped with the right skills for
the industry he sailed through his very first
placement interview and secured a job at KFC as
a Team Member with a monthly salary of INR
10,750. Today, Vikas has blossomed not just in his
professional life but also in his personal life
and he attributes this growth to his
time spent at Mahindra Pride
School.

Lifeline Express at

Bharatpur, Rajasthan
Health Support

September 2015

Even today, a large section of our
population grapples with poverty. When basic
necessities such as food, water and shelter are hard to acquire,
access to medical support seems like a distant dream for the underprivileged.
We have always regarded health support as an integral part of our social
interventions, and our aim has beento bring basic healthcare to the poor and
remote areas of our country.

Operated

Lifeline Express at Bharatpur got an overwhelming response with
patients receiving counseling and treatment for varied ailments.
Mr. Rajendra Singh Rathore, Health Minister, Government of
Rajasthan inaugurated the Lifeline Express and the project took
off at an accelerated pace.

Lifeline
Express

People were operated for cataract, cleft lip and hearing issues.
The volunteering surgeons screened the patients, post which
surgeries were performed. Other treatments including dental,
diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer and treatment of epilepsy
too were offered.

The world's first hospital on rails, Lifeline Express is a comprehensive healthcare
project aimed at providing free medical services to those belonging to financiallyweaker sections of society and geographically-remote pockets of the country.
M&M has not just been supporting this venture financially, but also by overseeing
the programme on the ground. Our Esops volunteers have being volunteering their
time and talent in chalking and rolling out the project to perfection.

Esops volunteers along with and several employees of the
channel partners enthusiastically participated in all phases of the
project, right from creating awareness about the project to the
closing ceremony.
The volunteering surgeons as well as their teams were ardent
about providing their services for this cause.

Launched by the Impact India Foundation, the Lifeline
Express consists of five fully air-conditioned coaches,
and is equipped with the latest medical equipment with
a view to provide the best possible healthcare services.

A mirror to society, a medium of entertainment, and a means to convey
strong messages, the impact of theatre on society is manifold. It can make
people laugh, cry and reflect on burning issues, leaving viewers richly
rewarded with new insights. Which is why, theatre is still one of the
strongest and most popular mediums of storytelling across geographies.
At Mahindra, we designed META to not only preserve stagecraft, but also
increase awareness and appreciation for the medium, and bring it into the
national spotlight. The project focuses equally on developing all theatrical
aspects such as playwriting, set and light designs, costumes, direction and
performance.

The META awards celebrated its 10th edition
in March 2016,and showcased 10 productions
which included plays like Mein Huun Yusuf

Starting this year, we have revised the reporting
format of Mahindra's sustainability performance.
While sustainability performance of M&M (Auto &
Farm Sector) has been reported individually in line
with GRI G4 guidelines, the sustainability highlights of
all the subsidiaries and associates of M&M have been
captured in a separate section. The reason for this
change in presentation is not just alignment with the
new G4 guidelines but also enhanced comparability
of sector performance. Some of our subsidiaries like
Mahindra Lifespaces and Mahindra Finance are
already publishing their individual reports.

RIVEN BY OUR PEOPLE
Overview
Our employees are our prime movers. A
collective force which sees no limits, finds
possibilities in problems and breaks fresh
ground, enabling the organisation and its
stakeholders to rise. It is hence only natural for
us to return the favour by empowering them to
rise by nurturing, motivating, and rewarding
them with growth, learning and leadership
opportunities. Equal focus is laid on hosting our
employees in a healthy and safe environment.

A case in point in Mahindra Susten's unique philosophy of safeguarding
Human Rights through:
• Including human rights principles in the contract clause for all service and
supplier contracts.
• Pilot sustainability assessment with Human Rights criteria.
• Frequent Human Rights training and awareness for staff.
• Labour camps before the onset of project execution to ensure safe working
conditions and dignity of individuals. These camps offer the workers
electricity, dining tents, separate toilets for men and women and access to
safe drinking water.

In the reporting year, Mahindra Intertrade conducted Human Rights awareness
training for Security Guards at Vadodara, Chakan, Nashik, and Bhopal.
We ensure to keep our ears to the ground and
understand the pulse of our employees
through a multitude of employee engagement
exercises. We connect with all our employees
across designations and departments in order
to include the views of individuals from diverse
groups in all strategic decisions. An equal
opportunity player, we remain on a pursuit of
offering employment and creating leaders
across hierarchies and businesses.

Human Rights &
Ethical Labour
Practices
Dignity is the basic right of every individual and
all Mahindra companies adhere to the UNGC
principles on Human Rights. We strictly
condemn acts like discrimination, forced &
compulsory labour and child labour within and
beyond Mahindra boundaries. Over and above
practicing the policy on human rights, our
businesses also incorporate new initiatives to
remain in tune with the need and nature of
the business as well as evolving standards.

Mahindra to harness the power of diversity across gender, physical abilities
and race. Below are a few examples highlighting how our various business
are leading by example:
• Mahindra Intertrade is replete with talented female personnel and its shop
floor with women employees is a stellar example for gender diversity.
• The Mahindra Intertrade Ltd. Service Centre at Vadodara has another first
to its credit with the first female security personnel.
• MLL is championing gender diversity through various milestones:
• Increase in female employees by 14.9% in FY 2015-16

that encompasses talents from varied walks of life.

Key initiatives:

Service Tax (GST) was conducted by
Mr. Diwakar Srivastava, Chief Commercial, to explain the concept of
GST. Another initiative 'Premier Learning'
is an opportunity for employees to
pursue a programme in leader
development at seminal institutes
like IIM, XLRI and ISB. A multi-skilling
platform named 'Unnayan' focuses on
cross-skilling through a unique
mentoring approach, empowering
people to enhance their capabilities
and thereby augment their job profile.
• Mahindra Susten has developed an
innovation induction module where the
idea and importance of sustainability
will be inculcated into the new joinees
right at the onboarding stage. Each
new employee is encouraged to 'Be a
Susteneer' by taking a pledge towards
adapting a green and sustainable
lifestyle. Additionally, a communication
plan has been chalked out featuring
knowledge sharing emailers to
sensitise employees towards the
emerging concepts of sustainability.
• Tech Mahindra has an in-house
Management Academy that grooms and
develops talent through a structured
'identify, develop, and leverage
potential' approach. Multiple learning
avenues are open for employees across
cadres. In the reporting year, 210
training sessions were undertaken to
train 22300+ employees on emerging
technologies. Further, 600+ e-learning
courses, 300+ technical documentations
and several video-based learning tools
were offered.
• MFCSL spearheaded various training
programmes like OHS training, Cultural
Value Training, Corporate Quality
Training, IMS & Audit Workshop, Six
Sigma yellow belt training and team
building workshops.

Our talent management processes do not end at attracting and recruiting
bright employees but also extend to offering multiple growth enablers ranging
from learning opportunities, career advancement to leadership building.
Learning is an unending journey at Mahindra. All our businesses have crafted
multiple training and development modules that enable employees to learn
and grow further in the career path.

Calculating Specific Consumption
We measure our environmental performance on absolute as well as specific
basis. The specific consumption is calculated by dividing absolute consumption
by a denominator based on the nature of business. For e.g., in case of
manufacturing business units, it is the number of units produced, whereas for
services, it is the number of employees, or units of services offered etc. The
denominators for the Group Companies are delineated in the following table:

Biodiversity
Conserving the variety of life on earth is becoming a serious issue due to factors such as habitat loss, degradation, and various kinds
of pollution. We are preserving the biodiversity and also restoring it through various endeavours:

Mahindra Susten

MLDL

• Planted 500 saplings at Bhandup pumping
station with an objective of putting a tap
on the depletion of mangroves in Mumbai

• Plantation of tree species native to the Boisar Area in Happinest

• Used alternative material to river sand in
cable trenches of the solar panel
installations to reduce the natural sand
consumption to zero

• Imparted knowledge on environmental conservation to children of 13
schools in Mumbai under the 'green army' campaign. The core idea
behind the Green Army campaign is to create a pool of One Million
Caring Citizens with sustainability embedded right from their
childhood. Since its launch in FY 2014-15, over 10,600 children and 5,300
people have been impacted by the programme.

• Optimised land grading in solar panel
installation to avoid disturbance to
natural ground terrain
• Developed 13,000 sq. ft. of land for
backyard farming and local crop
cultivation in two towns - Aruppukotai,
Tamil Nadu and Mulugu, Telangana

OCIAL PERFORMANCE
All our Companies own the same degree of
responsibility towards fostering social
inclusiveness, as they have towards business
growth and good governance. They contribute
in key areas of equitable development -

health & safety
education
skill building
The objective is to strengthen the base of the
pyramid, enable the marginalised with tools to
rise and change their world for the better.
All Mahindra Group Companies spearhead their
social interventions through Mahindra's
employee volunteering platform, Esops
(Employee Social Options). Tech Mahindra also
carries out its CSR activities through its social
arm - Tech Mahindra Foundation.

Out of these, at least 50% were girls/young women and 10% were people
with disabilities. Through a well-planned corporate volunteering programme,
the foundation galvanised 10,000+ associates, who contributed over
50,000+ hours.

Employability Programme
SMART (Skills for Market Training), the Foundation's flagship programme
stems from a vision of an educated, enlightened and employed India.
A range of specialised courses are offered:
Customer Relationships and Sales | Hospitality | IT-Enabled Services |
BPO | Lab Assistant | Multimedia | Nurse Aides | Office Administration |
Pharmacy Assistant | Quick Service Restaurants | Tally

FOUNDATION
The Foundation essentially works with children
and youth from less-privileged urban
communities of India in three core areas - school
education, employability and technical education.

In the current year, TMF reached
out to 80,000+ primary and
400,000+ secondary beneficiaries.

The Programme started with three centres in 2012,
and is currently running 65 centres at ten locations
across India.

All Round Improvement in School Education (ARISE)
Under this long-term school improvement programme, the Foundation
adopted 55 schools across India during the reporting year and is working with
18 partners to transform these schools into model schools of excellence.

When the floods affected the Coromandel Coast of Tamil Nadu, Andhra
Pradesh and Puducherry, Esopians at Chennai immediately responded. The
team first donated four cartons of clothes to children, women and men at
the Central Library Rangoon Street where 300 slum dwellers were displaced.
Then the Esopians teamed up with Vruksham Foundation NGO and
organised Medical Camp benefitting 327 people who were also provided
living basics like toiletries, buckets and bed. At Puducherry, Esops Team
provided food packets to almost 750 families of nearby villages.

a cage out of the fishing net. These cages will
enable the SHG to grow fishes in them. Not
only will this help them with their day-to-day
meals, but will also enhance their family
income.

limits on pollutant emissions from light road vehicles,
particularly for emissions of nitrogen particulates and oxides.
The Regulation also includes measures concerning access to
information on vehicles and their components and the
possibility of introducing tax incentives.

Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CDE) and Equivalent Carbon
Dioxide (CO2e) - are two related but distinct measures for
describing how much global warming a given type and
amount of greenhouse gas may cause, using the functionally
equivalent amount or concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) as
the reference Equivalent CO2 (CO2e) is the concentration of
CO2 that would cause the same level of radiative forcing as a
given type and concentration of greenhouse gas.
