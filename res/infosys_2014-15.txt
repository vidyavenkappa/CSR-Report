Sustainability
– A business
imperative

Infosys has been at the forefront of the movement
to plan action against climate change
Ramadas Kamath U.
Executive Vice President and Head – Infrastructure, Facilities, Administration,
Security, and Sustainability

The Global Risks 2015 report released by the World Economic Forum identifies the
failure to adapt to climate change as one of the major risks for the coming decade.
The nexus of food, water, energy and climate change has been identified by the US
National Intelligence Council as one of the four overarching mega-trends that will
shape the world in 2030.
Enterprises today can no longer turn a blind eye to the environment and the rapid
depletion of natural resources. While we are making laudable economic progress,
some of it is taking a toll on the limited resources on our planet and causing adverse
variations in the climate, which in turn threaten to jeopardize future progress. The

Infosys Sustainability Report 2014-15

threat is no longer theoretical, we have started experiencing the initial impact of
climate change on our businesses and daily life.
Climate change poses a grave risk to companies like ours on several fronts. Firstly,
an energy crisis is looming large on the horizon, threatening to disrupt our business
and increase cost of operations. Secondly, the impact of rising temperature levels
on fresh water bodies is enormous and could affect day‑to‑day operations of large
organizations like ours. Thirdly, the rising incidence of natural disasters due to climate
change may have a huge impact on assets, employees and business continuity.

Sustainability at Infosys

Infosys has always been at the forefront of the movement to chart an action plan
towards mitigating the adverse impact of climate change. In 2008, we became the
first Information and Communications Technology (ICT) company in India to declare
a goal of becoming carbon neutral by fiscal 2018 at the United Nations. We promised
to reduce our per capita electricity consumption by 50%, meet 100% of our electricity
requirements from renewable energy sources, and reduce our carbon intensity. We
have made significant progress towards achieving our targets. At the end of fiscal 2015,
we have reduced our per capita consumption of electricity by 46%. About 30% of our
energy requirements are met through renewable sources, and we have a well‑defined
plan to expand the share of renewables to address the chronic energy crisis in India.
This year, we also became the first Indian company to join the RE100, a global platform
for major companies committed to 100% renewable power. We have also lined up an
investment outlay of US $65 million to explore carbon‑offset projects in an attempt to
meet our commitment by 2018.
As we look back on the year gone by, we feel happy with our performance and look
forward to the future with excitement, as we implement our Renew and New strategy
for our clients and ourselves.
We continue to innovate on improving energy performance in buildings. We used
high‑quality engineering to develop Radiflux radiant panels in‑house, which are twice
as efficient as other products available in the market, at less than half the cost, and
50% less time required for installation. We were awarded the Leadership in Energy and
Environment Design (LEED) India Platinum rating for two of our buildings in Bengaluru
and Chennai in fiscal 2015. We now have 12 LEED Platinum‑rated buildings and two
buildings with the Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) 5-star
rating, making it a total of about 3.8 million sq. ft. of buildings having the highest level
of green certification, as on March 31, 2015.
We have been identified as a company leading climate change action by the Carbon
Disclosure Project (CDP). We improved our disclosure score to 97 this year as against
92 last year.

We have seen a marginal rise in our freshwater consumption this year and have
undertaken an elaborate exercise of ascertaining our water footprint across our
campuses in India, which would provide us with fresh insights to renew our existing
water strategies in the coming year. We have continued to focus on water monitoring
and measurements. We have also experimented with new technologies for managing
waste.
We have seen a marginal rise in our freshwater consumption this year and have started
an elaborate exercise of ascertaining our water footprint across our campuses in India,
which would provide us with fresh insights to renew our existing water strategies in
the coming year. We have also experimented with new technologies for managing
waste. Our commitment to preserving the rich flora and fauna in and around our
development centers is powered by our biodiversity policy. This year alone, we planted
over 80,000 saplings across our campuses.
A well-defined advocacy statement guides our actions across the globe. We engage
with various national and international bodies and organizations to influence and
lead transformation on a much larger scale across the world. Some of these include
the GRI, CDP, UNGC, the National Association of Software and Services Companies
(NASSCOM), the World Economic Forum (WEF), the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).
Our resource conservation efforts are not directed merely towards protecting the
environment but also towards creating a positive work environment at our campuses
that instill a sense of pride, boost morale and influence the overall employee experience.
Our state-of-the-art infrastructure continues to enthrall our clients and also serve as
hubs of learning and innovation for industry, academia and research organizations
across the globe.
Sustainability is a non-negotiable imperative for us that we hope will help us foster a
healthier environment for business and communities to thrive.

Sustainability at Infosys
As a global leader in consulting, technology, and outsourcing solutions, Infosys works
with clients in over 50 countries. Our experience gives our clients a distinct advantage,
helping them manage their businesses and power their transformation into smarter
organizations.
Our sustainability strategy forms the basis of running our business responsibly
and successfully. We work with our internal and external stakeholders to define
our sustainability strategy and goals. Our sustainability agenda focuses on social,
environment and economic dimensions and is based on the foundation of our
values, known in short as C-LIFE : Client value, Leadership by example, Integrity and
transparency, Fairness, and Excellence.
Our sustainability goals are part of our corporate scorecard. These goals are further
cascaded to leaders of business units and enabler functions with the requisite authority
to execute them. The Management’s discussion and analysis section in our Annual Report
highlights strategic priorities to achieve our economic, social and environmental goals
across short, medium and long-term horizons.

Infosys Sustainability Report 2014-15

We review the progress on material aspects concerning our stakeholders on a
regular basis and communicate the progress through appropriate channels. Periodic
discussions and reviews with the Board and its committees, the senior management
and other stakeholders across the organization help us work consistently towards
fulfilling the expectations of our direct and indirect stakeholders. This apart, our
enterprise-wide risk management framework monitors social and environmental risks
as part of the societal risks on a quarterly basis.
In October 2014, S. Gopalakrishnan stepped down as the Vice Chairman of the Board
and U. Ramadas Kamath, Executive Vice President and Head of Infrastructure was
given the additional responsibility as Head of Sustainability, under the guidance and
leadership of U. B. Pravin Rao, our Chief Operating Officer and whole-time director.
The following photo gallery highlights some of our sustainability efforts across

Governance
We believe in conducting our business in a fair and transparent manner. Our corporate
governance framework reflects our culture, policies, relationship with stakeholders, and
commitment to values. We always seek to ensure that our performance is driven by
integrity. This is vital to gaining and retaining the trust of our stakeholders.
We believe that an active, well‑informed and independent board is necessary to ensure
the highest standards of corporate governance. Our Board of Directors oversees the
Management’s functions and protects the long‑term interests of our stakeholders.
Our corporate governance framework ensures that we make timely disclosures and
share accurate information on our business and financial performance, as well as the
leadership and governance of the Company.
Our corporate governance philosophy is based on the following principles :
•	 Corporate governance standards should go beyond the letter of the law and satisfy
the spirit of the law
•	 Ensure transparency and maintain a high level of disclosure
•	 Clearly distinguish between personal conveniences and corporate resources
•	 Communicate externally, and truthfully, about how the Company is run internally
•	 Comply with the laws of all countries in which we operate
•	 Have a simple and transparent corporate structure driven solely by business needs
•	 The Management is the trustee of the shareholders’ capital and not the owner
We firmly believe that Board independence is essential for bringing objectivity and
transparency in the Management and in the dealings of the Company. As on March
31, 2015, the Board consists of 10 members out of which eight are independent
directors. An independent director is nominated as the chairperson of each of the
board committees : audit, nomination and remuneration, stakeholders relationship, risk
and strategy, and corporate social responsibility. Committed to following global best
practices, we substantially comply with the Euroshareholders Corporate Governance
Guidelines 2000 and the recommendations of the Conference Board Commission on
Public Trusts and Private Enterprises in the U.S. We also adhere to the principles of the
UNGC and the Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development (OECD).
For more details, refer to the Corporate governance report section in the Annual Report
2014-15, available on our website www.infosys.com.
Infosys Sustainability Report 2014-15

Compliance and anti‑corruption policies
Over the years, the Board has developed a set of robust corporate governance
guidelines that help fulfill our corporate responsibility towards our stakeholders. These
guidelines ensure that the Board has the necessary authority and processes to review
and evaluate our operations when required. Further, these guidelines allow the Board
to make decisions independent of the Management. The Board may change these
guidelines regularly to achieve our stated objectives.
The Code of Conduct and Ethics helps us maintain the highest standards of business
conduct and comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations including
anti‑bribery safeguards, ethical handling of conflicts of interests, and fair, accurate and
timely disclosure in reports and documents that are filed with the required regulatory
bodies. This is communicated to employees worldwide through training and awareness
programs, both online and instructor‑led, using multiple learning interventions. Every
employee compulsorily attends a session on values during his or her induction, and
acknowledges the Code of Conduct and Ethics through a sign-up process. The code of
conduct is available in English, which is our official business language. A Whistleblower
Policy, a Gift Policy, a strong grievance redressal body, an uncompromising stand on
value transgressions, and supportive ecosystems ensure the availability of adequate
mechanisms to enable a culture of disclosure.
To promote the highest ethical standards, we maintain a workplace that facilitates the
reporting of potential violations of Company policies and applicable laws. Employees are
empowered to raise concerns regarding potential violations easily and free of any fear of
retaliation. Suspected violations may be reported through the immediate supervisor, to the
chief compliance officer or even through an anonymous mail to whistleblower@infosys.com.
The report may also be directly sent to the audit committee, which is the highest governance
body for handling cases of violation of the code of conduct.
A compliance and ethics team has the mandate of overseeing the effective
implementation of the Code of Conduct in the organization. A compliance dashboard
is presented to the Board every quarter for review. Any advice on ethical and lawful
behavior and matters related to organizational integrity may be addressed to the
organization at askus@infosys.com.
No instances of regulatory non‑compliance were reported against us in fiscal 2015.

Our strategic objectives
Our strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains relevant
to the agenda of our clients, while generating profitable growth for our investors.
We will apply the priorities of our new business strategy of Renew and New to our
solution and service offerings, our client and employee engagement processes, and
to the operational processes of the Company. These translate to the following strategic
focus areas :
•	 Differentiate our solution and service offerings : We are embracing the concepts of
automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity, gain better accuracy
and reduce the total cost to our clients. We are also investing in new platforms such
as the Infosys Information Platform, and leveraging the strengths of Open source,
emerging mobile and digital technologies and Big Data analytics.
•	 Pursue strategic alliances and acquisitions : To develop alliances that complement
our core competencies, we are making strategic acquisitions that will amplify our
presence in certain market segments and accelerate the execution of our strategies.
•	 Build deep and impactful client relationships : We are investing in high-performing
consulting and business development teams for large transformative programs
of our clients, both in traditional IT areas as well as for their new digital business
initiatives.
•	 Build a culture within the Company that delivers innovation to clients : We are
enabling employees and client teams with training in Design Thinking methods
for better problem-finding and solving, besides creating environment, structures,
and ecosystems that will spur innovation across the Company. We have allocated
US $500 million towards an innovation fund to tap into innovation networks of
early-stage companies and universities to gain access to new thinking and business
models.

To sharpen our focus on competitive differentiation across services lines, we have
realigned our organizational structure in fiscal 2015. The realignment is effective April

The five global industry segments are :
•	 Financial Services (including Cards and Payments)
•	 Manufacturing
•	 Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods, and Logistics

•	 Cloud and Infrastructure Services
•	 Digital Integration Services
•	 Engineering Services
•	 Enterprise Package Application Services
•	 Independent Validation and Testing
•	 Management Consulting Services
Along with ensuring profitability for our investors, we remain focused on the need
to give back to society. Through the Infosys Foundation, we continue to expand our
reach and make a difference by empowering people and communities at the bottom
of the pyramid, and providing opportunities to improve their standards of living. The
Foundation received around US $42 million as grant from Infosys Limited in fiscal 2015.

•	 Attract and retain a global, diverse, motivated and high performing employee base :
A series of measures have been initiated to empower employees through trust,
accountability, training and career development.

Our strategic Objectives

Information security and data privacy
Our vision is to be a globally respected corporation. One of the imperatives of this
vision is the assurance of the security and privacy of information assets belonging
to the Company, and those that are entrusted to us by clients, employees, vendors,
investors and other stakeholders.
The following are our information security goals :
•	 Confidentiality : The assurance that information is accessible only to those authorized
to have access to it.
•	 Integrity : The assurance of the completeness and accuracy of the information
provided by us, and the integrity of its processing methods.
•	 Availability : The assurance that authorized users have access to information and
associated assets whenever they require.
Information can be stored, processed or transmitted in many different ways. We make
extensive use of information and communication technology (computers, high-speed
storage, communication devices etc.) for these purposes. We also use traditional means
of storing, processing and transmitting information — for example, writing or printing
on paper, or communicating over phone, fax or face-to-face conversations. Information
must always be appropriately protected, regardless of the manner in which it is stored,
processed or transmitted.
The following are some examples of how inadequate protection of information and
information assets can impact our capability to achieve and sustain our vision :
•	 A virus attack on a single computer in a network could lead to the virus spreading
to all other machines in the network, jeopardizing our work and business.
•	 Unauthorized alteration of the contents of our homepage on the Internet can
seriously affect our brand image.

Environmental stewardship

Assurance and framework

Brand building

compliance to the global data privacy and security requirements. We also follow the
guidelines of ISO 29100 to have necessary systems in place to safeguard information
of any category relevant to any entity in relation to the Company.
We leverage technology to protect, store, process or transmit information in different
ways using innovative and state-of-the-art tools and techniques. We have an
information security policy, and our security objective is to create an environment in
which our employees and third parties (vendors, contractors, consultants, and other
non-employees who are allowed access to Infosys facilities) comply with the policy in
their everyday practices and processes.
Our security infrastructure includes a variety of tools such as web content filtering,
data leakage monitoring, security information and events monitoring, vulnerability
assessment and penetration testing, intrusion prevention and detection systems.
As we cater to clients from diverse sectors such as banking, retail and telecommunications,
with most such engagements being regulated by data protection acts and involving the
processing of personal data, compliance with data privacy during project execution is
of utmost importance. However, the scope of data privacy in such client engagements
is often limited to contractual requirements — rather than regulatory requirements
— applicable to a data processor and agreed upon with our clients. Appropriate data
privacy policies, processes and review mechanisms have been deployed to ensure
compliance.
Along with unprecedented development in digital technologies that allows personal
data processing with greater ease, we are also witnessing stricter data privacy
legislations around the world. At Infosys, our focus is on continuous improvement of
measures to prepare ourselves for the new risks and opportunities arising out of the
changing business environment.

•	 Inappropriate disclosure of confidential client information, whether revealed to
unauthorized users on a computer system or through information revealed during
conversations, can lead to a violation of contractual agreements with the client,
resulting in financial loss and loss of trust.

The corporate Data Privacy Office is assisted by a privacy sub-council consisting of
senior representatives from various business process functions in managing the risks

and appropriate actions are taken to prevent recurrence. In fiscal 2015, four incidents
related to breach of customer data privacy were reported. Two incidents related to
data leaks were reported. All incidents have been addressed and closed and necessary
preventive measures have been taken to avoid future recurrence. In 2014, two incidents
relating to breach of customer data privacy were reported and in 2013, 24 incidents
were reported.

Recognition

Information risk management
We believe in going beyond compliance and implementing processes and systems to
ensure information security and data privacy along our value chain. We have introduced
necessary controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level and we operate based on the
confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements of the information shared by our
clients. All information transactions comply with international and national laws. Client
/ employee information is treated as confidential and processed on a need‑to‑know
basis. Any other controls agreed upon with the client are applied in processing the
information.

This year, the Data Security Council of India (DSCI) conferred on us an excellence award
for ‘Privacy in the outsourcing sector’. The award honors organizations that have taken
strategic, proactive and innovative privacy efforts to address real risks, build resilience,
increase trustworthiness and create a conducive environment for doing business, and
thus is able to harness data protection as a lever for business growth. The Infosys team
received the award at the Information Security Summit event held in Mumbai on
December 10, 2014. The jury also commended Infosys for its comprehensive privacy
framework, dedicated staff, robust governance structure, and ability to leverage
technology to create visibility over personal information and monitor compliance with
global laws and regulations.

We have a well-established program to generate information security metric to
demonstrate and verify control effectiveness on an ongoing basis. Various process
improvement measures are undertaken to continuously improve and strengthen the
information security posture.
Only Company-authorized devices and networks with proper data encryption
mechanisms to protect information assets are made available to employees and third
parties after a series of approvals, checks and balances. Any violations are treated on
high priority and with zero tolerance. We also have exceptions for any deviation from
the policy that are reviewed and authorized by the head of the Information Security
Group or the chairman of the Information Security Council or by individuals nominated
by them. We encourage our employees to clear their desks and screens, whenever
they leave their workstation to ensure zero risk of data / information misuse. We have

Intellectual property
We recognize the growing importance of Intellectual Property (IP) in our day-to-day
business. Our robust policies and practices minimize exposure to IP risks and maximize
business benefits. With an innovation-centric approach towards enhancing the services
efficiency and value-addition in our offerings, intellectual property links innovation and
commercialization.
It is with this view that the IP Cell at Infosys formulates strategies and has adopted a
two-pronged approach, comprising :
•	 Value enhancement
•	 Risk mitigation
While value enhancement focuses on generating proprietary intellectual property, risk
mitigation processes entail implementing initiatives or programs to ensure compliance

intellectual property assets have been translated into offerings for our clients. To enrich
and strengthen our research efforts, we have drafted a policy that incentivizes and
recognizes inventors through rewards at various levels. We believe this two-pronged
approach will, in the long term, enable us to be leaders in the industry for value
addition to our services and offerings and also for contribution to scientific progress.

Amplifying client value
As a global leader in consulting, technology, and outsourcing solutions, we enable
clients in over 50 countries to outperform the competition and stay ahead of the
innovation curve. We help enterprises transform and thrive in a changing world through
strategic consulting, operational leadership, and the co‑creation of breakthrough
solutions, including those in mobility, sustainability, big data, and cloud computing.
In a fast-changing world, new challenges and rising client expectations have become
the norm. Staying relevant to these changes and focusing on co‑creation of solutions,
integrated service offerings and embracing new technologies will help us position
ourselves as strategic partners for our clients.
Forging alliances and partnerships is a strategic imperative for us. We have a well‑defined
alliance strategy at the organizational level that enables business units to chart out
an alliance plan that guides global partnerships for co‑creating solutions. A strong
governance board regulates the global partnership programs. We have documented
processes to guide us through the lifecycle of selecting, engaging, managing, assessing
and terminating alliances. Risks relating to alliances are tracked at the business-unit
level and get aggregated to the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.
For more details, refer to the Risk Management Report in our Annual Report 2014-15

Engaging with clients
We maintain a continuous dialog with our clients on issues that concern their areas of
business. We host conferences periodically to forge closer ties with our clients, share
thought leadership on emerging business and technology topics, and offer insights
from some of the brightest practitioners of business, technology and leadership in the
world today. We host premier CXO‑level events annually in Europe and the Americas

Client satisfaction survey
Receiving regular feedback from our clients during and after the completion of a project
is a key objective of our client engagement strategy. We also gather ‘feedforward’, as
this allows us to understand the client’s expectations and needs and helps us make
the right investment decisions.
We believe in taking corrective actions and acting responsibly in all our interactions
with our clients. We gain insights and understand our clients better through our annual
Client Value Survey (CVS) and engagement level feedback. The survey framework
includes a structured questionnaire with a satisfaction rating on a seven‑point scale,
encompassing close to 30 parameters, with language versions in English, French,
German, Japanese and Spanish.
The feedback collection is done through a web survey hosted by an independent
organization, which ensures confidentiality.
The survey elicits responses on the following aspects, and feedback is analyzed and
action clusters are defined to apply differential approaches to deliver value to our
clients :
•	 Expectation and fulfilment : Top three expectations of CXOs and senior‑level
respondents from Infosys and their perception on fulfilment
•	 Client disposition : Gauging overall experience of working with us
•	 Business and technology priorities and expectations
•	 Service line feedback
•	 Comparison against ‘best‑of‑breed’ firms : Client‑selected benchmarks preferred over

A statistical analysis of this data provides inputs on core, moderate and breakaway
client groups, which the account teams use to evaluate the strength of their individual
relationships and to design interventions that create a positive and visible impact on
our clients. Various members across levels engage with clients to seek their feedback
and inputs on service delivery, product expectations and technology requirements.

Client feedback score
Client feedback score has seen an improvement this year. The overall index has
improved by 2.8 points. An increase has been noted on all key parameters in the areas
of Satisfaction, Loyalty, Advocacy and Business Value for spend.

Engagement level feedback
Engagement level feedback (ELF) acts as a mechanism to gather response from clients
on their experience of engagements with us, be it projects, ongoing outsourced
support, or consulting‑led transformation programs. The feedback is sought multiple
times during and at the end of the engagement on 14 different parameters, covering
areas such as service delivery management, quality of products or services delivered,
and behavioral competencies involved in the engagement.
Diverse teams such as project delivery, quality and the process group study and
evaluate set parameters during an engagement to improve deliverables and to attain
client satisfaction and delight. ELF is also treated as the lead indicator in our annual
client‑value survey. Based on the account‑level ELF, the client partner and the delivery
anchor drive improvement programs for the account.

Client complaints
Grievance handling is built into our client engagement process with defined escalation
levels. Our robust client complaints mechanism allows us to seek feedback from our
clients on an ongoing basis and communicate the resolution of issues / complaints. In
fiscal 2015, and during the last five years, there were no cases filed by any stakeholder
against the Company regarding unfair trade practices, irresponsible advertising and /
or anti‑competitive behavior. There are no pending cases as on March 31, 2015.

Deployment of processes, frameworks and tools
We ensure that we deliver measurable value in every stage of our service offerings to
clients. A strong focus on quality, usage of tools and technology and lean processes
ensure greater efficiency and speed of execution for our clients. Some of the processes,
frameworks and tool innovations developed and deployed during fiscal 2015 are as
follows :
Infosys Continuous Integration Platform (ICIP) : This platform helps project teams
embrace agility, enhance overall application quality and improve cycle time by enabling
shorter feedback cycles in an automated manner. It is a centralized web‑based platform
that offers a simple‑to‑use interface to configure the Java / J2EE and .NET applications
for continuous integration. The platform provides automation across several lifecycle
tasks, generates build scripts and triggers relevant validations, thus helping projects
achieve and realize continuous delivery capabilities and associated benefits.
Infosys Transition Advantage (ITA) : ITA is a differentiating transition management
platform for seamless planning, execution and governance across all phases of simple,
complex, multi‑tower and multi-site transitions. ITA enables Infosys to bring an efficient
approach that delivers service excellence and satisfaction to clients. It ensures smooth,
risk mitigated transition execution, and brings transparency by allowing all program
stakeholders including clients to monitor progress on the program.
Program Management Center of Excellence (PgMCOE) : Infosys’ new program
management framework, ENRICH, is based on best practices proposed by international
program management standards and the learnings derived from Infosys’ vast experience
in executing large and complex programs. ENRICH (and its patented predecessor –
TRANSCEED) empowers our program and project management community to deliver
value-based outcomes for business transformation and specification-led programs.
PgMCOE supports the program management community with our proprietary iSeek
framework which is used for program modeling, simulation, stakeholder engagement,
and planning. We also ensure that our program management community is enabled on
the latest program management trends, tools and techniques as well as international
program management certifications.

Project Management Center of Excellence (PMCoE) : PMCoE offers value‑added
enablement and consulting services to the Infosys project management community
to help achieve industry-leading project management performance. PMCoE helps
maintain strong project management competency at Infosys by strengthening internal
certifications in alignment with business requirements and enabling employees for
global external certifications. PMCoE deploys tools to enhance project planning
practices, mitigate risks and improve delivery efficiency, leading to better margins.
Requirement Elicitation and Analysis Framework (REAP) : This framework is being
deployed to help establish accurate, complete and unambiguous requirements in
projects where clients are not clear on the complete scope and require faster delivery.
The key features of REAP are Requirement Ambiguity Checker, Testability Assessment
Tool, Requirement Risk Assessment Tool, Requirement Quality Analyzer and Quick
Reference Cards. The REAP Workbench is the automation of the REAP process using
the IBM CLM tool. This workbench has the added benefit of the REAP process over and
above the inherent benefits of the IBM CLM tool suite. The IBM tools which constitute
this Workbench are – Rational Requirements Composer (RRC), Rational Team Concert
(RTC) and Rational Quality Manager (RQM). The key objectives of this framework are
to reduce project cycle time and reduce the number of change requests apart from
optimizing project costs and delivery, improving resource effectiveness and efficiency
and decreasing rework effort when engaging with clients.
Individual Productivity (IPr) framework : As we continue to focus on frameworks to drive
process efficiencies, we rolled out a first-of‑its kind framework to gauge efficiencies and
effectiveness. This also enables projects with a measurement lever which can measure
efficiency at a granular level. This will help in identifying the root cause and taking
actions for improvement in an effective manner. This framework measures individual

productivity in an objective manner, providing data to individuals so that they can plan
for self‑improvement, help ascertain training and developmental needs and drive team
excellence. Good improvements are seen in productivity levels, leading to business
benefits for both the Company and its clients.
Infosys Comprehensive Quality : This approach looks at each lifecycle stage as a phase
where defects and issues can be injected as well as detected by using methods
and tools that allow for measurable and objective perspective on the Quality of
the application. Be it application development or application maintenance, the
Comprehensive Quality approach provides definite value in terms of its clear focus on
a unified process and tools to drive significant benefits and value. The key benefits of
using the Comprehensive Quality approach include :
•	 Contain – Ability to detect a large majority of defects in the same lifecycle stage
•	 Measure – Facilitate measurement of quality using lead indicators or metric
•	 Early detection – Early detection of defects lowers rework and burden on subsequent
stages
•	 Unified scalable approach driven by processes and tools

Business continuity management
Phoenix, our business continuity management program, is headed by U. B. Pravin Rao,
our Chief Operating Officer. The Phoenix framework enables us to identify business
impacts of any disruption in our services and allows us to frame plans to manage related
risks. Business continuity plans are regularly tested at the corporate, development
center and account levels. Regular drills ensure the collaboration of various internal
departments and active participation of employees to ensure readiness.

Fueling India’s
social‑economic
progress : The
India Post story

For more than 150 years, the Department of Posts (DoP) has been the backbone of
India’s communication system, with 155,015 post offices across the country, the DoP
has the most widely distributed postal network in the world and has played a crucial
role in India’s socio-economic development. It touches the lives of Indians in many
different ways.

Core Banking Solution (CBS)
In addition to delivering mail, DoP has also been operating saving schemes since 1882.
Seven schemes are being offered – Savings Account, Recurring Deposit, Time Deposit,
Monthly Income Account Scheme, Senior Citizens’ Savings Scheme, Public Provident
Fund and National Savings Certificates. The total number of accounts in small savings
schemes is about 298 million.
In order to provide best‑in‑class customer service, deliver new services and improve
operational efficiencies, the DoP has undertaken an end‑to‑end IT modernization
project. The project will collaboratively drive innovation and fundamentally integrate
disparate businesses to deliver a broad set of benefits to the stakeholders. As part of
enhancing the Post Office Savings Bank through IT, Finacle Core Banking Solution (CBS)
is being implemented across India covering all the post offices.
Finacle Core Banking Solution (CBS) enables customers to operate their accounts
and get account-related services from any CBS post office in the country. Benefits
such as ‘Anywhere Anytime Banking’, net banking, RTGS and NEFT will also be made
available for the post office customer. The objective of CBS is to provide faster and
easier banking services through the Internet, mobile devices and ATMs. The post office
ATM will facilitate withdraw of money for the customer anytime. Out of 25,500 offices,

Infosys Sustainability Report 2014-15

2,590 have already gone live on Finacle CBS. We are also currently working on a solution
that will enable post offices to provide financial services to the rural and semi‑rural
population of the country.

Postal Life Insurance (PLI)
Postal Life Insurance was started in 1884 and is open for employees of all central
and state government departments, nationalized banks, public sector undertakings,
financial institutions, local bodies like municipalities and zila parishads, and educational
institutions aided by the government. The Rural Postal Life Insurance (Rural PLI) scheme
was started in 1995 for improving the financial inclusion of rural public, to benefit
weaker sections of the society and women workers of rural areas in particular.
Postal Life Insurance offers the best return on investment in the life insurance sector in
India. The McCamish-based IT solution will enable the PLI and Rural PLI customers to
pay their premium at any post office counter
across the country, make online premium
payment, check their insurance accounts
online, take maturity and loan payment
from any Post office. The Core Insurance
Solution will be rolled out across India and
will integrate 810 insurance processing
centres for faster claim settlement and after
sales service. As many as 14,682,363 policies
have been migrated so far, and around 80,016
offices are live on McCamish till date.

Societal impact :
The Infosys
Enterprise
Gamification
Platform
Enterprise Gamification is a custom defined gamification strategy and design configured
into an enterprise gamification platform that is integrated into a host application (B2E,
B2B, B2C) using a set of robust gamification API services and UI widgets, and monitored
using gamification analytics to fine tune the user experience.
Enterprise Gamification borrows design features from social games and game
mechanics (i.e. awarding points, badges, levels of achievement and leader boards)
which are used to keep gamers motivated and engaged, as well as reward their

behavior, activities and continued play or engagement. Enterprise Gamification is the
application of game design principles in the context of the enterprise to improve user
engagement.
Enterprise Gamification taps into people’s natural desires for competition, achievement,
gratification, social value, fun, and external gains. It not only improves engagement
and adoption, but also improves productivity, retention, customer engagement and
satisfaction, employee morale, as well as reduces costs and drives up revenues.

The Infosys Enterprise Gamification Platform can be leveraged by clients through a simple 4‑step process, called as the Infosys Gamification Framework.

Responsible Youth Banking

•	 This solution will give banks an opportunity to expand their millennial customer
base, which is largely unbanked.

This year, we leveraged the Infosys Enterprise Gamification platform to launch a
first‑of‑its‑kind mobile‑based banking solution for young people – Finacle Youth
Banking. The digital banking solution, specially designed for young customers between
the ages of 12 to 18, is aimed at making banking a fun experience, while giving them
a sense of financial responsibility. While the solution has several easy‑to‑use features,
some of its other highlights are as follows :

•	 Banks can deploy the solution seamlessly using the Finacle suite of products or any
other third‑party or in‑house‑developed applications.

•	 While account holders will have freedom to operate their accounts, any transactions
beyond preset limits will have to be approved by the guardian before completion.
•	 Interactive features include ‘goal management’ for savings, ‘do transactions’ for
payments, fund transfers, online shopping, and gamification.

Fostering employee engagement
Being an organization that is dependent on the competence of its people to deliver
value to clients, our employees are our most valued assets. We aim to attract and retain
the best talent in the market, and hire from the best universities in large numbers. Our
senior leaders participate in recruitment drives to position the Company effectively and
attract the best talent. We strive to create an environment of meritocracy that provides
all our employees with opportunities to learn, excel and progress.
Although we had a spike in attrition numbers in some quarters, the trend has been
a declining one. Our focus on employee engagement through various initiatives
continued, along with initiatives to foster a culture of innovation within the Company.
A first‑of‑its‑kind crowdsourcing initiative called Murmuration was launched, calling
employees to actively participate in culture‑building and strategy‑definition. The Infosys
Global Hackathon (an initiative to encourage rapid problem solving through the use
of technology) was also unique in its scale and reach. To enhance leadership connect
further, a number of town halls were held at various locations, along with frequent
emails and video messages to communicate company-related strategy messages with
our employees. In addition, there were online chats with the leadership, on InfyBubble,
our enterprise networking platform. We are working on bringing innovation to every
project at Infosys, to help increase client delight and inculcate an environment of
innovation across the organization. Our investment in training continued with Design
Thinking workshops, which covered over 25,000 individuals. We have more workshops
in the offing.
Several programs were launched during the year to enable employees to enhance their
skills and capabilities. MyWorks was re‑launched to help employees work in projects
of their interest alongside their current projects. The Expert Track, a niche space for
those wanting to focus on particular areas of technology and technology‑enabled
solutions, was introduced. We have continued to focus on employee development and
have rolled out about 20,000 promotions in the last year. We revamped our employee
satisfaction survey this year and over 100,000 employees participated in the survey.
The findings were analyzed and a special task force was instituted to roll out programs
to address issues and implement suggestions given by our employees.
In addition, we have well‑defined channels to address employee grievances relating
to work, discrimination and harassment. The global nature of our business necessitates

Infosys Sustainability Report 2014-15

a focus on diversity and inclusion. Our diversity and inclusion programs embrace
employees across gender, age, nationality and physical abilities. We are committed
to providing a work environment that is free from discrimination and harassment for
all our employees.
The Company is an equal‑opportunity employer and makes employment decisions
based on merit and business needs. The Company’s policy prohibits harassment of
any kind, including harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth or related medical
conditions, race, religion, creed, color, gender, national origin or ancestry, physical or
mental disability, medical condition, marital status, age, or on any other basis protected
by laws of the governments where we operate.
Our CEO and MD, Vishal Sikka believes that great products and solutions are created
when there is a synthesis of different perspectives, and where there is diversity. We have
set up a Global Diversity Council to help equip our women employees with initiative,
insights and opportunities as they tread the path to leadership. We also believe in
hiring the best talent that will bring in diverse skills, backgrounds and understanding
that will boost our business and economic performance.
As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), we created a Human
Rights Statement. This statement guides our policies and practices dealing with
our operations, partnerships, investment agreements and contracts, and covers the
Company’s stand on compliance with global norms on providing a harassment‑free
workplace, freedom of association, workplace health and safety and anti‑corruption
safeguards. A stringent internal and independent review and governance framework
ensures that we are compliant with current and ongoing best practices related to
human capital. We have work councils in every region of our operations to ensure
compliance.
While we hire the best talent, we believe that it is our responsibility to also build
future talent and provide the required support for academic institutions to align with
the needs of the industry. Campus Connect, our industry‑academia flagship program,
partners with engineering colleges to prepare their talent pool for the requirements
in the IT space.

Guiding principles
We recognize the right to freedom of association through Collective Bargaining
Agreements (CBA) as per the laws of the land. Where mandated by the law, we have
100% employees under the CBA. We provide policies, forums and support groups for
hearing and addressing the concerns of our employees, and resolving their issues or
conflicts in a fair and transparent manner. A de minimis percentage of our employees
are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The minimum notice period for
significant operational changes are included in the collective bargaining agreements
wherever mandated by law. In countries where there is no such mandate to include
them in the CBA or in countries where CBA is not mandated, we abide by the local
laws prevailing in the land. In all other scenarios, Infosys prescribes the notice period
based on the type of change.

The pursuit of excellence is an integral part of our core values. The Awards for Excellence
(AFE) were initiated in 1995 to recognize the performance and contribution of our
employees. The awards have grown over the years to encompass the scope of work
done at Infosys, and awards are given at the global and regional levels. With categories
such as Account Management, Center (DC) Management, Excellence in Projects,
Infosys Champions, Innovation, Internal Customer Delight, People Development, Sales
and Marketing, Value Champions, Unit / Department Management, Sustainability /
Social Consciousness, Most Valuable Contributor — the Awards for Excellence are an
inspiration to our employees to challenge all boundaries and produce outstanding
results. This year, we renewed some categories, and introduced new sub‑categories as
well. We also saw a 28% increase in the number of nominations received as compared
to last year. For more details, refer to the Awards for Excellence section in our Annual
Report 2014-15 available on www.infosys.com.

Only employees hired in these countries are covered.

Effective communication and channels
We have established multiple channels to reach out to our employees at all levels.
We have interactive sessions with the Management across our campuses. In addition,
we have employee communication channels such as organization‑wide mailers,
newsletters within units, our corporate intranet (Sparsh), corporate TV channel (InfyTV),
corporate radio channel (InfyRadio), our social networking hub (InfyBubble), the annual
employee satisfaction survey – LITMUS (Let’s Interact on Themes that Matter to Us), the
CEO Forum (Ask Vishal), blogs, our exclusive platform for managers (Managers Portal)
and our internal branding and marketing portal, MPlus.

Employee resource groups
Our global employees represent diverse backgrounds and skills. We have created a
number of employee resource groups that address the need of our diverse workforce,
including community participation, networking, cultural enrichment and support
based on affinity, ability and gender. These resource groups conduct programs and
initiatives such as peer‑to‑peer forums, leader speak series, conferences, special events
and celebrations to ensure continuous engagement with our workforce.

This year, we launched Murmuration – a unique, crowd‑sourcing initiative, across
the organization to foster innovation and collaboration within the organization.
We received 2,650 ideas from employees across our locations and business units.

seven of our campuses and has had positive outcomes for over 1,300 employees so far. Network members also support
employees with severe depression or mental health‑related concerns by assisting the human resources department and
counselors to identify and refer such employees for further treatment. Samaritans are also engaged in awareness initiatives
and conducting internal workshops on listening, basic counseling and addressing issues related to depression and suicidal
tendencies.

Work‑life balance
The role of professionals in the current social environment demands flexibility in
managing an optimal work‑life balance. Helping employees attain personal as well
as professional goals creates an engaged workforce. It is this social responsibility that
enterprises today are addressing through various work‑life balance programs.
We have a dedicated team within our Human Resources (HR) group to assess the
needs of our workforce. The following are significant HR policies that support work‑life
balance and inclusivity :
•	 Paid maternity leave
•	 Extended maternity leave
•	 Sabbatical for personal reasons (1)
•	 Paternity leave
•	 Adoption leave
•	 Part‑time, flexi‑hours and selective telecommuting
•	 Sabbatical for community service

that cover the entire competency spectrum, including technical, managerial, process
skills, industry domain knowledge and leadership skills, both for our employees and for
our strategic clients. The training requirements of our employees are assessed based on
roles, domain and individual competency needs. ETA focuses on talent development
and facilitates the Foundation Program, Continuous Education and Outreach Programs.
The following are the learning avenues for our employees within the organization :

	 Sabbatical for personal reasons includes leave taken by new parents, or those on account of sickness, adoption and

Talent fulfillment
In an attempt to balance employee career aspirations and business needs, we instituted
a unique Talent Fulfillment function – a central, organization‑wide function to plan
talent needs, enhance utilization of existing talent, improve employee morale through
continuous engagement and to re‑skill the workforce to adapt to changing business
needs. A dedicated team of Delivery and HR professionals, as part of this function,
engage with every member moving into the central talent pool after their project
concludes. Employees in the talent pool get to express their aspirations, constraints
and expectations which get recorded in our Talent Management system. The talent
fulfillment teams across the world access this system to identify the right talents
based on the skills and availability and map them according to their requirements.
This function also focuses on forecasting the talent needs and planning for the same,

The Foundation Program

Collaborative learning

The Foundation Program is a flagship program that has received recognition from the
American Society for Talent and Development (ASTD). This 21‑week‑long residential
training program for engineering graduates has helped us train software engineers who
are hired directly from colleges. This program has been evaluated by the Federation
of International Services (FIS), U.S., and is considered equivalent to a B.Sc. in computer
science (recognized by universities in the U.S.). During fiscal 2015, about 12,500 freshers
were trained.

Knowledge Management : Collaboration through knowledge‑sharing is an important
component of learning and education. A primary goal of our Knowledge Management
(KM) strategy has been the creation of an ecosystem for continuous employee
education that effectively combines formal, semi‑formal and informal learning to
enable the sustenance of organizational productivity, efficiency and quality in the
face of rapid changes in the business needs of its customers. Accordingly, several KM
solutions have been deployed over the years, individually or in combination with others,

to aid the knowledge‑based actions of employees in the broad areas of technology,
methodology and industry domains. These solutions are made available through
multiple channels and are accessible in different modes to facilitate collaboration
across the organization.
We have provided several knowledge management and collaboration channels to
leverage organizational knowledge. The participation across these channels during
fiscal 2015 was as follows :
KM Portal : A searchable knowledge repository of about 98,800 artifacts, which recorded
over 1.2 million artifact downloads from nearly 112,000 employees.
Konnect : A professional networking platform that includes discussions, Q&A,
automatically enriched expert profiles, tagging and support for communities. Konnect
recorded over 1.6 million activities from around 84,000 employees in fiscal 2015.
TeamWiki : An exclusive Wiki‑based solution for team collaboration with versatile site
customization and an ability to provide fine‑grained access restrictions on views and
edits. About 794,000 activities were recorded from nearly 23,000 employees.
Each of these solutions is branded suitably and diligently deployed through intense
interactions with employees across the world as part of our interventions into client
projects. We have received many awards for KM from the external benchmarking
agency, the KNOW network including 10 Global MAKE (Most Admired Knowledge
Enterprise) Awards, 12 Asian MAKE Awards and 10 Indian MAKE Awards over the last
decade.

Higher education opportunities for employees
We encourage our employees to pursue higher education programs offered in part‑time
/ distance learning mode by reputed educational institutes. The objective of our Higher
Education Support (HES) policy is to enhance the competency and qualifications of our
employees and expose them to global standards of education. As part of this policy,
our ETA department identifies high quality, part‑time / distance learning programs at
reputed educational institutes and promotes these among employees.

We work with reputed educational institutes in India and from other parts of the world
to develop collaborative programs. One such example is the master’s degree programs
developed in collaboration with Coventry University, U.K. The university enabled a
‘Work‑Based Learning Credit System’ for our employees. This is a cost‑effective
international degree program. This model is a trendsetter for industry‑academia
collaboration for employee development and is a first‑of‑its‑kind in Global Applied
Engineering Education.
As per our policy, employees can avail an extended leave of up to two years to pursue
higher education at reputed educational institutions.

Competency Development Program (CDP 3.0)
It has always been our endeavor to enhance the competencies and capabilities of
our employees. We rolled out a holistic Competency Development Program 3.0
(CDP 3.0) in 2011 and enhanced it to CDP 3.1 in 2014 with greater focus on Technical
competency and Business communication. CDP is a learning credit point system,
which brings relevance and flexibility in competency development for a role across
multiple competency dimensions. The credit point system is aligned to an employee’s
role tenure. The average prescribed / estimated learning effort across all employee
categories up to senior level is computed based on the CDP 3.1 credit point mechanism.

Code of conduct and ethics
We believe that converting good governance into action by employees on an
everyday basis is critical to building an ethical organization. To achieve this, a strong
and well‑articulated Code of Conduct and Ethics, which also outlines anti‑bribery
provisions, has been put in place. This is communicated to all employees worldwide
through training and awareness programs, both online and instructor‑led, using
multiple learning media. The programs include talks by leaders, contests, blogs,
portals, and a popular ‘Do you know?’ series that ensures the dissemination of updated
information at regular intervals. Every employee compulsorily attends a session on
values during his or her induction and acknowledges the Code of Conduct and
Ethics through a sign‑up process. A Whistleblower Policy, a strong grievance redressal
body, an uncompromising stand on value transgressions, and supportive ecosystems
encourage a culture of disclosure.

Leadership development
The Infosys Leadership Institute (ILI) was established in early 2001. The vision of ILI
is to be a globally respected institution committed to developing Infosys leaders of
today and tomorrow. The primary focus of the institute is to develop and prepare the
title holders of the organization for current and future executive leadership positions.

Infosys Sustainability Report 2014-15

Approximately 530 title holders from across Infosys and its subsidiaries benefit from the
Institute’s programs each year. A 360 degree feedback process aids in the creation of a
personalized leadership developmental plan for each leader. ILI employs a wide range
of developmental approaches including classroom training, individualized coaching,
experience sharing, and ‘leaders teach’ sessions. Some of the programs offered by the
institute in fiscal 2015 include :
•	 Leadership development planning workshops
•	 Charismatic and instrumental leadership
•	 Science of influence
•	 Principles of persuasion
•	 Leadership, decision making, and organizational performance
•	 Leader as coach
•	 Crucial accountability
•	 Crucial conversations
In addition, ILI also conducts ‘Leaders Teach’ sessions facilitated by senior Infosys leaders
that includes topics such as  :
•	 Relational leadership
•	 Leading change
•	 Closing large deals
•	 Managing difficult client situations – A consulting approach

Performance and career management
We offer a comprehensive suite of programs, policies, tools and interventions that
facilitate robust performance and career management for our global workforce.
All employees have clearly articulated goals for performance. A half yearly appraisal
allows employees to formally take stock of their performance and report on milestones
at the halfway mark. The annual performance appraisal helps set new goals and
identifies competency development needs through the Individual Development
Program (IDP). All our employees received a formal performance appraisal and review
during the reporting period.
A management and leadership 360 degree feedback enables managers and leaders to
get a holistic view of their performance. It helps them to take appropriate actions for
enhancing skills and competencies identified through due analysis of the feedback.
Our career development program encourages a partnership between employees and
the organization with the following objectives :
•	 Encourage employees to take ownership of their careers by charting their career
paths based on their aspirations.
•	 Design and offer opportunities to develop capabilities and competencies, and
provide a well‑rounded career experience for our employees.
•	 Guide employees on capabilities, competencies, career opportunities, optimal roles,
and career objectives.
•	 Enable managers to support employees in the process of career development by
providing guidance.

creative ideas, transform them into solutions and take them to the market with skill,
agility and imagination. While the core management teams were the first to participate
in dT workshops, the program has been taken forward to cover over 25,000 Infoscions
globally. Design Thinking has also been introduced as a component in the Foundation
Program for fresh engineers. As we are affecting a cultural transformation in the way
we look at problems so that we creatively come up with innovative solutions through a
user‑centric approach, dT has also been a life‑enhancing skill for our employees, as the
learnings are not only applicable at the workplace, but also in non‑work‑related spaces.

Boosting innovation ecosystems
The Murmuration initiative that we launched this year across the organization
generated a huge response from employees. From the 2,650 ideas that were submitted,
the final shortlist of 10 ideas was further strengthened by the idea authors and assigned
mentors. Some of these have been taken forward for implementation. A global
Hackathon was also organized to encourage rapid problem‑solving through the use
of technology, and boost the ‘Maker Culture’ – an emerging learning methodology
that encourages shared social learning (hearing and seeing) by focusing on building
artifacts (doing), while also teaching the scientific methods of experimentation,
risk‑taking and continuous improvement that are critical to problem‑finding, and then

As an organization that values partnerships, we also have a series of programs that are
extended to our key suppliers and contractors.

Creating a culture of active learning
We have collaborated with Stanford University’s school of design, the d.school, to
embark on Design Thinking (dT) workshops for our employees. We believe that the
dT framework will change the way we investigate, innovate and implement solutions
for our clients, through a user‑centric approach. Our endeavor is to use dT to harness

moving on to solving those problems. While our dT initiative enables us to identify
relevant problems, we believe that the Global Hackathons will supplement this by
allowing everyone to rapidly prototype possible solutions to these problems. The
Hackathons were opened up under three categories :
•	 Open track : Participants were allowed to select a critical problem of their choice and
prototype solutions using open source or proprietary technologies.
•	 Internal systems track : The participants had to identify and improve on any aspect
of Infosys’ internal IT applications.
•	 Hardware track : This unique track encouraged participants to combine open source
platforms with hardware sensors, to build solutions in areas like Internet of Things.
Infoscions from 18 locations across the globe participated enthusiastically, and a host
of ideas emerged. The Hackathon helped bring our innovation mindset to the fore,
and forged new interest and enthusiasm in thinking differently and solving problems
with agility and creativity.

The SWAT initiative
We launched SWAT (derived from Special Weapons And Tactics a popular term used in
law enforcement organizations ) this year with an aim to run a large organization‑level
change management initiative with the objective to identify employee challenges that
cut across the organization and then work towards resolving these issues to create a
better work environment.
Driven from the top, the SWAT had sponsorship from the Chief Operating Officer,
whose continuous supervision and guidance ensured that the different working groups
within the organization worked in cohesion to address the employee challenges. Ever
since its rollout in September 2014, SWAT has addressed and resolved challenges in
every critical function that concerns employees such as travel, claims, infrastructure,
procurement, work environment, etc.
SWAT initiated its work with a structured approach of interviewing people across the
diverse sections of employees, along with conducting focused group, open‑ended
discussions with the core middle management community to gain an understanding
of the challenges. The exhaustive inputs were then classified as ‘Essential, Desirable and
Vital’ categories. The categorization was arrived at by surveying the user groups and
requesting them to rank their top challenges. The constitution of the SWAT – Program
Management Office was ensured to be a heterogeneous group (with participation

from Delivery, HR, Business Enabler functions, Voice of Youth and an independent
corporate team), that collectively had the ability and power to evaluate the proposed
changes and implement them.
The SWAT core team acts as the driving force to engage user groups at appropriate
junctures to evaluate the progress on changes and provide suggestions. Regular
communication on progress of the proposed changes was ensured through delivery
channels in the organization, such as InfyTV, blogs on Sparsh and mass mailers. These
channels had representation from COO, Senior leadership in the organization from
Business Enabling Functions, Delivery and even from the employees who shared their
inputs. SWAT had a dedicated hour in the Annual Strategy Planning meet for 2015,
where the need, purpose and progress was shared with the topmost leadership of the
organization. We perceive an increased confidence among employees on this large
initiative and have already started witnessing the results in the last two quarters of
fiscal 2015.

Equal opportunity
We are committed to providing a work environment free of discrimination and
harassment. The Company is an equal opportunities employer and makes employment
decisions based on merit and business needs. The Company policy prohibits
harassment of any kind, including harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth or
related medical conditions, race, religious creed, color, gender identity, national origin
or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital status, age, sexual
orientation, or any other basis protected by federal, state, or local law or ordinance or
regulation. Any such harassment is unlawful. The Company’s anti-discrimination and
anti‑harassment policies apply to all persons involved in the operation of the Company
and prohibits harassment by any employee of the Company towards other employees,
including supervisors, outside vendors, and clients. It also prohibits discrimination
or harassment based on the perception that anyone has any of the characteristics
mentioned above, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having
any of these characteristics. The Company believes in equal work opportunities for
all employees and does not condone favoritism or the appearance of favoritism at
the workplace. Equal opportunity and fair treatment are part of our Code of Conduct
to which all employees subscribe. One of the core values of the organization is
excellence, and the selection, compensation and career progression of employees is
based on merit.

Diversity and inclusion
Our workforce includes people from diverse nationalities, age groups, cultures,
employment histories, and levels of physical ability. We use a multi‑pronged approach
to promote diversity and inclusivity within the organization. The principles and goals
of the Universal Declaration of Human rights are at the center of our Diversity and
Inclusion (D&I) strategy. Our diversity and inclusion approach is incremental and
business‑driven. Our Diversity and Inclusion Office works with a vision ‘to create
an inclusive workplace and leverage the power of D&I for sustainable, competitive
advantage, where employees from different backgrounds have the opportunity to
participate, develop and contribute freely and equitably’.
We implement our diversity goals through ‘ACTION’, which stands for Auditing
inclusivity and diversity levels, Creating change agents, Training managers, Initiating
and implementing work models, Organizing and assisting affinity groups, and
networking with external bodies to benchmark practices. Some of our diversity
initiatives conducted across our campuses in fiscal year 2015 are as follows :
•	 To strengthen our diversity practices, we instituted a ‘Global Diversity Council’ under
the CEO’s sponsorship. This Council has representation from across geographies and
will work to improve our performance across three diversity indicators – Gender,
nationality and people with disability.
•	 A drama‑based training program, ‘The Unconscious Bias’, was conducted across our
India locations.
•	 An e‑learning course, ‘Understanding Diversity and Inclusion’ was launched to

OZONE – The Health, Safety and Environmental Management
System (HSEMS)
We have established a Health, Safety and Environmental Management System and are
certified to OHSAS 18001 specifications at most of our campuses in India. The HSEMS
initiative, christened OZONE, helps us comply with all applicable legal requirements
across our operations.
The HSEMS includes well-defined policies and procedures which support the :
•	 Identification and management of hazards and risks related to health and safety
•	 Identification and management of activities causing environmental impacts
•	 Creation of processes for operational controls
•	 Definition of HSE objectives and targets that are achieved through management
programs
•	 Identification of HSE training needs and ensuring of periodic training
•	 Establishment and operation of Occupational Health and Safety Committees
•	 Periodic review of HSE performance
Our HSEMS includes the following components :
Risk management : Risk management includes the identification of hazards for all
activities including new or modified activities, products and services, implementation
of measures to minimize or control impacts, and monitoring the same in a structured
manner. Ergonomics‑related ailments have been identified as one of the health
concerns which is prevalent in our kind of work environment. Instances of dry eye
syndrome, myalgia, are reported frequently. Workstations and furniture are designed
and procured after considering their ergonomic advantages. Physiotherapists are
available in most campuses in India and they conduct regular sessions on back care,
posture maintenance and repetitive strain injuries.
Safety committee : Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) Committees are set up both at
the corporate level and at each of our campuses. The committees comprise employees,
management and cross‑functional teams. The representation of employees in safety
committees is 100%. The OH&S committee brings employees and the Management
together in a non‑adversarial, cooperative effort to promote OH&S at the workplace.

The committee is responsible for :
•	 Conducting investigations of reported incidents.
•	 Assisting in the development and implementation of the best possible OH&S
policies, plans and procedures for eliminating or minimizing the occupational risks,
and providing an opportunity for raising concerns related to health and safety.
•	 Discussing, exploring and recommending solutions for various OH&S‑related issues.
Incident reporting and investigation : Incidents can be reported by employees through
an internal application and also through mails. Incidents which are reported are
investigated and analyzed and appropriate corrective actions / preventive measures
are taken to reduce future injuries and losses. Investigations focus on root causes and
system failures. The OH&S committee is responsible for conducting these investigations.
Training on Health, Safety and Environment : Training needs are identified based
on the nature of jobs, which may have a significant impact on the environment or
may pose occupational health and safety risks. Training includes awareness building,
mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS training is also a
part of employee induction programs. E‑learning modules have also been rolled out
for creating awareness. An OHSAS e-learning module is also available to the global
workforce.
A process for tracking and analyzing of occupational incidents has been established.
The incident, frequency and severity rates based on the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards
– IS 3786 :1983) and BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics – OSHA) standards for our operations

	 The 2014 numbers have been updated based on an audit observation. We currently do not have systems in
place to capture information about absenteeism rate and occupational disease rate.

During the current fiscal, we had one fatality at our site, involving an independent
contractor. Root cause analysis was carried out and strict measures to mitigate similar
risks across all locations have been undertaken through management interventions
as part of preventive measure. Risk assessments were also reviewed and appropriate
mitigation measures undertaken. We have also had one lost time incident with two
lost time days in the same category. Appropriate actions were taken after root cause
analysis and risk assessments revisited. However, the severity rates for the same have
not been reported due to the complexity of the capturing process and computation of
man hours related to independent contractors. We propose to streamline our processes
and systems to capture data related to contract workers and visitors by fiscal 2018.
A total of 65 incidents have been reported at our construction sites. No fatalities were
reported. The health and safety team, in collaboration with the internal audit team, has
embarked on several preventive measures to improve safety at our construction sites.

Promoting responsible supply chain – Vendors and partners
Being an Information Technology (IT) and consulting company, our solutions and
services rely more on intellectual assets than on physical assets. Our supply chain
implications are primarily related to our large supplier base for the procurement of
goods and services to support our operations. This has encouraged us to strengthen
our responsible supply chain practices progressively every year. We have a well‑defined
mechanism to receive and address social and environmental grievances from all our
stakeholders. In order to strengthen responsible business practices in our supply chain,
a four‑stage integrated framework called VIVA was implemented in fiscal year 2013.
The VIVA framework includes :
•	 Visioning – Drafting policies and guidelines and operating code for the supply chain
•	 Inculcating – Focusing on process improvements
•	 Valuing – Creating awareness and providing training and competency building
•	 Assessing – Assessing supplier performance along environmental, social and
governance parameters.
As a best practice, we have formulated the following policies and guidelines for
managing our supply chain responsibly :
•	 A Responsible Supply Chain Policy that categorizes our suppliers into three broad
categories — people, services and products — was launched in 2013.
•	 A Supplier Code of Conduct was administered to all key suppliers in 2014.
•	 A Master Service Agreement (MSA) document that covers all regulatory and
mandatory compliance from the governments concerned is signed with all our
vendors. The MSA mandates the vendor to abide by the regulatory and governmental
laws applicable.
We also expect our suppliers to support and respect the protection of internationally
proclaimed human rights and to ensure that they are not complicit in human rights
abuses. Our contracts have appropriate clauses and checks to prevent the employment
of child labor or forced labor in any form. We also provide forums such as Sambandh,
our annual vendor meet, where suppliers can voice their concerns and issues.

To facilitate better risk assessment, we have further classified the suppliers under 14
segments. This year, we have institutionalized the supplier risk assessment across the
14 sub‑categories of suppliers with the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework
at the organizational level. Supplier risks will now be rolled up to the ’Societal’ category
of our ERM framework.

The 3I model uses three important determinants to gauge Infosys’ ability to control /
influence the supplier operations in order to address material aspects.
1.	 Proximity : The proximity of the supplier location to initiate a meaningful
engagement.
2.	 Capability : The capability and competence available within Infosys to positively
engage with suppliers on the aspects that are important.
3.	 Dependency : The extent of business dependency the supplier has on Infosys. A
high value business aids supplier response.
The model prescribes the engagement mode based on the aforementioned
determinants.
This year, we have ‘involved’ all supplier segments working within our boundary
covering ‘People’ and ‘Services’ categories (9 out of 14 segments) by conducting
training, assessments and audits on Health and Safety, Compliance and Anti‑Corruption
safeguards, Human Rights, and Anti‑Harassment regulations.

In fiscal 2015, 1,652 new suppliers were empaneled. We had revised our empanelment
guidelines to include Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) parameters last
year but as most of our new suppliers empaneled are one‑time providers of products
and services, we have decided to screen only long‑standing suppliers as part of the
re‑evaluation process that they undergo every year, starting fiscal 2015. We engage
with local suppliers (‘local suppliers’ means India‑based suppliers) for our ‘People’ and
‘Services’ categories. The proportion of spending on domestic suppliers at significant
locations of operations was about 75% for fiscal 2015.
In addition to the above, we have regularized the frequency of inspections through the
year. Food inspections are carried out by catering committees (that has representation
from the Facilities department and employees in all campuses) on food and beverage
suppliers. Vehicle inspections are carried out on transportation suppliers to assess the
quality of the vehicles provided for employee commute. A comprehensive Human
Rights assessment covering labor practices, discrimination, health and safety was
also carried out across supplier segments across three large development centers
(Bengaluru, Pune and Mysuru).

In line with our philosophy of equal opportunity and inclusivity, we track the business
we do in India, under the MSMED Act, and in the U.S. under the MBE / WBE group. We
intend to strengthen our diversity and inclusion practices in our supply chain in the
coming year.
All our supply chain service providers working within our boundary are included as
part of our environmental footprint. At present, our ability to ascertain the influence
of our product suppliers (outside our boundary) on the environment is limited. We
are currently exploring methodologies to ascertain the impact of suppliers outside
our boundary on the environment, especially on material aspects such as emissions,
energy, waste and water.
This year, through these engagements, we have covered eight out of the 14 supplier
segments, approximately 57% of our supplier segments through training. About five
out of 14 supplier segments have been covered under assessments or audits, covering
approximately 35% of the supply chain.

Enabling communities for a better future
We are responsible towards all our stakeholders, investors, clients, employees, vendors
/ partners, governments and communities in ensuring that we conduct our business
ethically. A key aspect of honoring our social contract is to work in the area of community
development, particularly in education and the creation of jobs through direct and
indirect investment of time, effort, and funds. This is done through our CSR strategy
driven by a Board committee, direct monetary support, organization‑led projects,
employee‑driven initiatives and our community empathy policy. We support the
volunteering efforts of our employees. Besides supporting employee‑led CSR groups and
eco groups at our campuses, we also have the ‘I, Citizen of the Earth’ (iCoE) program to
support the development of social leadership competencies and to promote responsible
citizenship among our employees. As a corporation, we are committed to supporting
and nurturing our employees and the community around us. This is the only way we can
create wealth and grow together.

Corporate social responsibility
Our commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is aimed at sustainable
development of the communities where we have a major presence such as our
offices and development centers. Along with sustained economic performance,
environmental and social stewardship are also key factors for holistic business growth.
With this firm belief, we established the Infosys Foundation, the Infosys Foundation
USA and the Infosys Science Foundation, which achieve distinct goals that have been
set as part of our CSR strategy for the company. For more details, refer to the Corporate
Social Responsibility section in the Annual Report 2014‑15, available on our website
www.infosys.com.

Infosys Foundation
We are committed to the communities where we have our operations. This has led to
the creation of Infosys Foundation to support the underprivileged sections of society
across India. A not‑for‑profit initiative aimed at fulfilling the social responsibility of
Infosys, the Infosys Foundation creates opportunities and strives towards a more
equitable society.

The Infosys Foundation prides itself on working with the poorest of the poor, selecting
projects with infinite care and working in areas that are normally overlooked by the
larger society.
The highlights of the work done during fiscal 2015 have been published in the
Foundation’s report, available on http://www.infosys.com/infosys‑foundation/

Infosys Foundation USA
Infosys Foundation USA is a non‑profit organization focused on bridging the digital
divide in America. It aims to give children, young adults, and workers across the United
States the skills they need to become creators, and not just consumers, of technology.
The Infosys USA Foundation continues its association with the New York Academy of
Sciences in sponsoring STEM initiatives across schools in New York. Discussions are on
with the Girl Scouts to expand the reach of the STEM mentoring programs across all
states of the U.S. The Foundation team also participated in a program for revitalizing
schools across boroughs of New York City and in Newark, New Jersey, under the aegis
of Martin Luther King’s Day of Service and New York Cares Day.

Infosys Science Foundation
The Infosys Prize instituted by the Infosys Science Foundation (ISF) endeavors to elevate
the prestige of science and research in India and inspire young Indians to choose a
vocation in research. The award is given annually to honor outstanding achievements
of contemporary researchers and scientists across six categories, namely, Engineering
and Computer Sciences, Humanities, Life Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Physical
Sciences and Social Sciences, each carrying a prize of a gold medal, a citation and a

infrastructure for government schools, and train faculty across schools and colleges.
We work closely with educational institutions across the country to improve access to
and quality of education offered in schools and universities.

Campus Connect
As a primary stakeholder in creating a vibrant talent pool of future engineering
graduates, we launched Campus Connect (CC) in May 2004, a first‑of‑its‑kind
industry‑academia partnership program. CC aims to be a forum where some of
our best practices can be shared with institutions. CC also helps align the needs of
institutions, faculty and students with those of the IT industry to raise the employability
of engineering students.
For effective and fast‑paced learning, the CC program organizes conclaves, road shows
at educational institutions, faculty enablement programs, industrial visits for students
and faculty, seminars and workshops, programming contests for students, sabbaticals
for the teaching staff to take up refresher courses, technical events, research paper
sponsorships and soft‑skill training for students and faculty members.
We are also working with autonomous engineering institutions across the country to
co‑create industry electives in the areas of foundational computer science, soft‑skills
and advanced topics like business intelligence and enterprise architecture. Many
of these co‑created electives have already been included in the curricula of several
institutions.
For more details on Campus Connect, visit https://campusconnect.infosys.com.

Aspirations2020
In 2007, Campus Connect launched Aspirations2020, a programming contest aimed
at fostering creativity, teamwork and innovation in building new software programs.
The contest helps students test their ability to perform in challenging situations, and
thus replicates an industry environment. This contest is held in collaboration with the
Association for Computing Machinery International Collegiate Programming Contest
(ACM‑ICPC) that focuses on execution excellence in demonstrating competencies
needed for young engineers.

Imbibing social leadership
I, Citizen of Earth (iCOE) is an Infosys program to build a culture of responsible citizenship
among Infoscions around the world. Through iCOE, we aim to do the following :
•	 Envision a common purpose for the development of communities around us
•	 Enable voluntary effort of Infoscions to integrate with the vision and sustainability
goals of the Company
•	 Engage with Infoscions to help them become change agents and ambassadors for
a better tomorrow
•	 Embed a culture of global citizenship and innovation for sustainable development
among our employees
We believe responsible citizenship behaviors can be developed through social
leadership competencies. We set up InFLUENCE (Infosys Framework for Learning Using
External Community Engagement), a framework to recognize employee volunteering
efforts and to develop social empathy. Through InFLUENCE, employees can get
additional learning credit under our Competency Development Program 3.0 for their
volunteering efforts.

As part of SPARK, we engaged with over 38,460 teachers during the year. Since its
launch in 2008, the program has reached over 916,460 teachers.

SPRING – An
Infosys China
initiative

With around 40 full-time members and 100 Infoscions onboard, SPRING, the
employee‑voluntary group at our China center, operates with the singular objective
of ’giving back to the society’. Since its commencement in 2007, it has been working
towards improving the lives of underprivileged children and the differently‑abled.
SPRING has been a key contributor for the ’Giving Tree’ program that aims to help the
underprivileged children by providing them with a bag of new clothes, stationery items
and toys worth 200 RMB per bag during the spring holidays in China. This program
helps to inculcate the habit of giving for a good cause among a large section of our
employees in China. Collection drives across all our Development Centers in China.
The volunteers visit the selected schools and distribute the bags, along with the gifts
to the children. Until the end of this fiscal, the’ Giving Tree’ program has successfully
completed six cycles of the donation program. Volunteers are also involved in
organizing skill development activities during weekends.
The SPRING team’s activities are based on a set of well‑defined goals, and roles and
responsibilities for its members. Activities are planned by the core team and an anchor
is selected for the each activity. Another independent team has been set up to manage
the finances in a transparent manner.
Currently headed by Gopi Chand, who acts as the coordinator, and Simon Li, the
associate coordinator, SPRING has been consistently recognized for its contributions

Pioneering resource conservation
Infosys has always been at the forefront in taking up environmental conservation across
its operations. As we focus on our material aspects — energy, water, emissions and
waste — we continue to pioneer new technologies at our new facilities while investing
in measures to renew our existing infrastructure to improve performance and enhance
resource‑efficiency. We continue to demonstrate that such investments are not just
environmentally sound but also financially viable, and are replicable innovations as
well. Some of the significant achievements in resource conservation are highlighted
in this section of the report.

Green buildings
In fiscal 2015, we were awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environment Design
(LEED) India Platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) for two of
our buildings located in Bengaluru and Chennai. We now have 12 LEED Platinum‑rated
buildings, and two buildings with the Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment
(GRIHA) 5-star rating covering a total of about 3.8 million sq. ft. with the highest level
of green certification.

Central Command Center
Our Central Command Center in Bengaluru helps us remotely monitor and optimize
our building operations. We now manage over 11 million sq. ft. of smart buildings,
energy management systems, solar PV systems, data center power usage effectiveness,
battery-management systems, energy consumption for sewage treatment plants, and
weather stations for their performance across our campuses. Operations data flowing
into the command center from various systems across different campuses is used to
review and optimize operations, drive resource conservation, perform fault detection
and diagnostics, and ensure a high level of comfort and indoor air quality to the
building occupants. For example, chiller-plant performance data from all chiller plants
across Infosys campuses in India is compared on a weekly basis for optimization. This
data also helps us validate our current design and improve designs for future buildings
and systems. We are in the process of deploying and connecting smart water meters
to the Central Command Center in Bengaluru, to ensure the continuous monitoring of
water use across different locations and identify opportunities for water conservation.
Central Energy Management System (CEMS) : We have upgraded our existing energy
management system to a more powerful and capable Central Energy Management
System, an enterprise-level energy monitoring and information tool. We have added
over 600 new energy meters, and integrated energy meters in third-party applications
like the building management systems, chiller-plant managers, diesel generation-set
SCADA systems, taking the total number of integrated energy meters across campuses
to 2,500. We have now installed HT energy metering systems at campus sub-station
level for all campuses for detailed energy analysis and optimization. GPRS technology

connectivity was not available.
The integration of all energy meters from various systems and locations is allowing us
to compare and benchmark buildings and sub-systems performance across different
locations. We have started using this data to identify new areas of improvements for
driving energy conservation. Metric like per capita energy use, energy performance
index for buildings, ‘office’ and ‘after-office’ energy use are used to identify opportunities
for further investigation.

Light fixtures with occupancy sensors
We have replaced T5 lamps with LED fixtures having in‑built occupancy sensors at our
Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram campuses. The sensors work on the passive infrared
(PIR) technology and detect movements within the coverage area and accordingly alter
the lighting levels and switch off the lights when there are no occupants in the room.
The highest impact is observed during after-office hours when the building occupancy
is low. These light fixtures have reduced our energy consumption by about 40%, as
compared to what we were able to achieve using conventional T5 lamps.

Façade retrofits
Air conditioning is the biggest energy consumer in buildings. Building envelope has a
big impact on occupant comfort as well as air conditioning requirement as it shields
the interior of the building from high and low ambient temperatures. Some of the
buildings in our campuses, initially designed as glass buildings, were uncomfortable
for people to work and resulted in high energy consumption. We retrofitted the
façade of these buildings by reducing the amount of glass, replacing single glass with
double glazing, and adding insulation to the walls. This retrofit reduced the amount
of heat entering the building and thus resulted in reduced air conditioning energy
consumption and increased comfort for the occupants. We plan to implement façade
retrofits in other buildings across our campuses.

Façade lighting
We have designed and implemented an innovative façade lighting system at one of
our buildings at our Mangaluru campus that has a built‑up area of 100,000 sq. ft. We
have installed LED light fixtures to highlight specific elements of the building façade,
making it aesthetically appealing and enhancing viewers’ experience at night. With
the use of efficient light fixtures, the lighting load for the entire façade of the building
is a mere 246 watts.

Exterior lighting retrofit
The exterior lighting system at our Chennai Sholinganallur campus has been upgraded
with LED light fixtures. We have revamped the entire lighting system and installed
low‑wattage LED streetlights to improve visibility for employee movement and safety.
We have also replaced the conventional CFL and metal halide light fixtures with
efficient LED lights. This has resulted in a reduction in the lighting load by about 37%,
as compared to that achieved by the use of conventional light fixtures.

Electronically commutated (EC) fans

Environmental stewardship

Assurance and framework

Our environmental performance

We have replaced our high‑capacity exhaust fans with multiple smaller electronically
commutated (EC) fans at our Chennai campus. EC fans consist of fewer components
as compared to the conventional belt‑driven fans, thereby reducing the maintenance
costs. Also, these fans are smaller in size, with low vibration and noise levels. The
installation of EC fans has led to a reduction in energy consumption of nearly 83%, or
60,000 units per year.

the building. Passive RDHx enables rack cooling, where chilled water for cooling is
pumped directly to the racks rather than to the entire room. Chilled water is supplied
at 21 degrees as against seven degrees in the case of conventional designs, thereby
minimizing energy consumption to a great extent. Servers are cooled using passive
RDHx without fans. All the pumps and fans in the data center are based on efficient
EC motors, further optimizing the use of energy. Server rack water connections are
designed for hot swapping i.e. cooling capacity can be added or removed from the
cooling system while the data center is in operation. 

Heat pumps

Reduction in connected load

Heat pump is the reverse of refrigeration cycle. It makes use of the freely available heat
energy from ambient air to heat water and generates cold air as a by-product. The hot
water generated from heat pumps is used in washers and driers in the laundry, thereby
eliminating the use of diesel. We also utilize the rejected cold air from heat pumps to
cool the laundry area, making the space comfortable for the laundry staff. For example,
diesel boilers have been replaced with heat pumps at the laundry in our Mysuru
campus, eliminating the use of about 400 liters of diesel per day. In addition to this,
heat pumps have also been installed in our employee care centres for supplementing
solar hot water system and food courts for generating hot water for dish washing
purpose across different campuses. Heat pumps being 3.5 times more efficient than
electric heaters, have eliminated the use of 4,000 kW of connected load.

Our concerted efforts to redesign and retrofit our existing buildings have helped us
achieve dramatic reductions in our connected load and energy consumption. Deep
green retrofits in our air conditioning systems have helped us achieve a 13.5 MW
connected load reduction in the last four years. In fiscal 2015 alone, air conditioning
retrofits have resulted in a 3.4 MW reduction in the connected load. Most retrofits have
a short payback period of less than three years and can be easily replicated in other
commercial buildings.

High‑efficiency data centers
We have designed our data centers using emerging technologies to optimize energy
consumption. Our new data center at our Bengaluru campus has been constructed
with the most innovative designs in the industry. One of its unique features is that
all the auxiliaries are DC‑powered by high‑efficiency variable frequency drives
(VFD), optimizing energy consumption based on ambient conditions. The 300 kW
data center has been designed according to Tier‑3 standards, ranging from 24-27
degree Celsius. The average power utilization effectiveness (PUE) of this data center is
estimated to be 1.08. The data center uses a combination of passive cooling and Rear
Door Heat Exchanger (RDHx) systems. The passive cooling system, based on direct
and indirect evaporative technology, utilizes a minimum amount of fan power. Cold
water is generated from cooling towers for 99% of operating hours annually, and the
remaining 1% is achieved through chilled water tapped from the central plant serving

Infosys Sustainability Report 2014-15

Smart water metering
We have installed smart water meters on many of our campuses to enable online
monitoring of water consumption, and identify leakages, wastage and opportunities
for reduction. These meters have the ability to communicate with the Building
Management System (BMS), which helps us monitor water consumption in real time.
We have installed 128 smart water meters at our Pune campus, 31 at the Bhubaneswar
campus, and 40 at the Chandigarh campus till date. We are in the process of installing
smart water meters on all of our other campuses as well across India.

Preventing water leakages
We have undertaken water piping retrofit to eliminate leakages and minimize water
wastage. Conventional polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes for potable water supply have
been replaced with medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) pipes. These pipes require
less number of fittings and have a long life of 50 years as compared to conventional
pipes, which use multiple fittings and last only for 10-15 years. MDPE pipes require less
maintenance as compared to PVC pipes and can be easily installed in a cost effective

manner. MDPE pipes do not lead to rusting and corrosion even during adverse soil
conditions, thereby eliminating the scope of water leakages to a great extent.

Regulating water consumption
We have installed more than 25,000 pressure compensating aerators (PCA) in water
faucets across all campuses during fiscal 2015. PCAs provide a constant flow rate of 0.5
gpm through variable pressure situations, optimizing water use to a great extent. In
addition, we have also installed about 290 waterless urinals at our Bengaluru, Hyderabad
and Bhubaneswar campuses during the same period. Existing urinal systems have been
retrofitted with waterless urinals with the installation of key valves. Over 610 key valves
have been installed in Pune, Bengaluru and Mysuru during the same period. Waterless
urinals do not require water for flushing, thereby reducing water consumption and
energy use for pumping and treating water. We plan to install this technology in all
our new buildings across India.

Rainwater harvesting
We harvest rainwater for the purpose of increasing the groundwater levels to ensure
more water is available for ourselves and for others. We harvest rainwater through
rooftop rainwater harvesting and the use of deep-well injection systems. Rainwater
from the roof is directed into a storage tank, where it is then filtered, treated, and then
used for domestic purposes. In fiscal 2015, 42% of our freshwater requirements in our
new building in was met using rainwater harvested in the monsoon months. Rainwater
is also collected and directed deep into the ground through in-house injection wells,
thereby increasing the groundwater tables. In total, 67 deep-well injection systems
have been built for groundwater recharge across different campuses in India. Each
injection well is capable of recharging at least 50,000 liters of water per day. During
this fiscal, we have constructed 21 deep-well injection systems on our Pune campus
and 19 on our Bengaluru campus, to maximize water sequestration.

reduce the use of water and minimize the cost of water treatment, but also increase the
efficiency of the cooling towers, owing to the low temperature of condensate water.
This system has been implemented at our Thiruvananthapuram campus, and we are
planning to replicate it at our other campuses across India as well.

Free cooling from DG exhaust heat
Our campuses are equipped with 100 per cent power back-up through diesel generator
sets (DG sets) across all locations. Our Chennai campus partially operates on DG power
for over six hours a day due to frequent power outages in Tamil Nadu. While this
was a challenge, it also offered an opportunity to deploy innovative technology. We
implemented vapor absorption cooling technology, which generates cooling from
waste heat. DG sets, when in continuous operation, let out a lot of waste heat in form
of flue gases. We installed waste heat recovery system at our DG set plant in Chennai
and coupled it with vapor absorption chillers to produce about 400 TR of free cooling
from 4,000 KVA of DG sets in operation. On an average, we generate about 1600 ton
hour of free cooling per day from vapor absorption and reduce electric demand from
regular chillers.

Waste water treatment
We strive to recycle and reuse every possible drop of water. Our zero liquid discharge
policy helps us achieve this through recycling and reusing 100 per cent wastewater
in our aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology based sewage treatment
plants. To make our treatment methodology efficient, we piloted the anaerobic
MBR wastewater treatment technology and found that it requires 30% lesser energy,
generates about 60% lesser sludge, and utilizes lesser space compared to the aerobic
MBR technology. We are currently planning to implement this technology in one of
the sewage treatment plants in our campus.

eliminated dependency on freshwater for cooling tower water needs. We plan to
implement this strategy in our other campuses across India.

Capacitive de-ionization (CDI) water treatment
We currently use reverse osmosis (RO) systems for water treatment. However, we have
evaluated the capacitive de-ionization (CDI) technology, which is an energy-efficient
water treatment system. The reject from the CDI system is about 10-15%, as compared
to 40-60% in the case of RO systems. Also, the energy consumption resulting from the
use of the CDI technology is expected to be 60% lower than that resulting from the use
of RO systems. Hence, we are planning to replace our RO systems with the CDI system
to ensure high-quality water treatment and optimum energy use.

Harnessing solar energy
We have installed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on the rooftop of one of our buildings
in Bengaluru to harvest solar energy. The unique feature of this experiment is that
five different kinds of solar PV technologies, namely, Polycrystalline, Monocrystalline,
Hetero Junction Intrinsic Thin (HIT), Copper Indium Selenide Thin (CSI), and Cadmium
Telluride Thin (Cd-Te) films, are being compared on the same roof. This project will
analyze the effects of different weather conditions on the performance of the PV
technologies. This plant is expected to meet over 10% of the total electricity demand
of this building. We are carrying out this study to demonstrate the viability of the
best solar PV technology available in the market through continuous monitoring and
analysis of energy-generation data in real time.

Treated waste water for air conditioning
With our constant efforts to optimize water use, we have ensured that the entire
cooling tower make -up water requirements are met from treated wastewater in our
Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai campuses. We have implemented appropriate
water treatment technologies for the treated water coming from our sewage treatment
plants, making it suitable for cooling tower requirements. This initiative has completely

Green technology innovations
We have pioneered the use of radiant cooling technology in India through the
deployment of radiant slab and radiant panel-based cooling systems. We realized
that the available radiant panel-based cooling solutions in the market today may not
be cost-effective in India. Hence, through high-quality engineering, we developed
Radiflux panels in-house, which use chilled water for cooling. These panels are two
times more efficient than other products available in the market, less than half the
cost, and take 50% less time for installation. They are also much more efficient, flexible
and easily replicable. This technology can be deployed on a large scale and has the
potential to transform the way cooling is done in India. We have applied for India, US
and European patents for this product.

Beema bamboo
We have planted Beema bamboo to maximize carbon sequestration. About 30,000
Beema bamboo plants have been planted in our Sarjapur campus in Bengaluru. Beema
bamboo has the capability to grow one foot per day at its peak, creating a natural
canopy and cooling the surrounding area. We are expecting production of 750 tons
of biomass from 30 acres in the first harvest, 1000 tons in the 2nd harvest, and 1200
tons from the 3rd harvest onwards. In addition to reducing carbon footprint, Beema
bamboo can be used as an energy crop for generating oil, charcoal, ethanol, and power
through gasification.

Carbon neutrality
Infosys has committed to become carbon neutral across all emissions by 2018. Scope 1
and 2 emissions are being addressed through energy efficiency initiatives and through
solar power plant installations and purchase of green power. Scope 3 emissions related
to employee commute and business travel, which comprise over 50% of the total
emissions, require carbon offset projects to be implemented. Infosys is now looking
at implementing different projects that offset carbon emissions as well as have strong
benefits for society. Potential projects being evaluated include rural electrification, rural
biogas projects, biomass projects, afforestation, efficient cookstoves, etc.

Renewing existing
facilities through
retrofits

We have demonstrated a remarkable energy performance of our buildings through
smart building designs and retrofits, and by pioneering the use of green technologies.
We focus on building automation and controls as a strategy to control and monitor our
building comfort, indoor air quality, operations, and energy and water consumption
patterns, which in turn help us derive mechanisms to optimize our use of these
resources. We have about 7 million sq. ft. of new buildings, which have smart building
management systems. We plan to develop our existing buildings to the highest
efficiency standards, and make them intelligent and smart. As part of this initiative,
we have undertaken smart building retrofits of 10 of our buildings at our Pune campus,
covering 2.7 million sq. ft. of area.
It has been our endeavor to develop intelligent buildings that effectively manage
multiple variables such as conditions for occupancy, weather conditions, operating
hours, occupant behavior, and equipment efficiencies, thereby creating a healthy work
environment for employees and achieving operational excellence.
We have implemented a host of efficiency measures, including intelligent control
algorithms, scheduling of equipment, occupancy sensors for meeting rooms and
cabins, and demand-controlled ventilation systems, to optimize the performance
of our buildings. Critical Additionally, controls for air handling units (AHU) based on
supply air temperature, the fire-alarm central command center, and water efficiency
are other critical interventions that have helped us minimize resource consumption
and eliminate wastage

Direct Digital Control (DDC) systems integrate multiple systems into a cohesive, single
unit, facilitating automated controlling and monitoring. Our robust data-backup
mechanisms accurately capture and store data, thereby eliminating the possibility
of data loss. Critical alarms due to malfunctions are notified through SMS, to ensure
immediate corrective action without affecting efficiency and occupant comfort. These
smart buildings can be accessed through Infosys’ intranet system globally, enabling
the continuous monitoring and analysis of energy data in real time by our technical
experts.
All the 10 buildings that were chosen for the retrofit project were retrofitted within
a short duration of three months. This was attained through effective project
management and coordination among multiple teams, including our Facilities, HVAC,
electrical, water metering, and IT teams. This project is among the biggest and fastest
smart building retrofit projects at Infosys. It has resulted in lower operating costs,
enhanced equipment life, healthier indoor air quality, and improved occupant comfort
and satisfaction.
This case clearly demonstrates that smart building retrofits are viable and cost-effective,
on a large scale. The retrofits are expected to save a significant amount of energy, and
have an attractive payback period of just four years. With a high replication potential,
this data-driven initiative makes an unassailable business case for large companies to
undertake smart building retrofits in their existing buildings.

Our smart buildings use a combination of controllers, sensors, actuators, feedback
systems, and energy-saving intelligence to optimize operations. Advanced BACnet

Ensuring
uninterrupted
power supply

IT offices, with all of their computers for employees and data centers, need uninterrupted
power supply (UPS) for maintaining stability of operations even at the time of power
fluctuations and outages. Power failure without reliable backup may result in the
unavailability of data for users, or could even lead to complete loss of data. Therefore,
a robust UPS system with high reliability and efficiency is critical to delivering constant
services to our clients and ensuring business continuity.
For optimum energy utilization, we decided to retrofit inefficient UPS systems with
efficient ones. A temporary shutdown of systems was required for carrying out this
retrofit, which we meticulously planned and implemented in a phased manner, so that
our daily business operations would not be affected.
We replaced conventional UPS systems with energy-efficient modular UPS systems, to
reduce our installed capacity and energy consumption. Modular UPS systems offer the
highest levels of efficiency and flexibility, through a unique system design with cuttingedge architecture, consisting of five to 10 independent, hot, swappable modules. These
modules allow for the online interchangeability of UPS systems. Each module within
the UPS system has a rectifier, inverter, static bypass, and processor, thereby eliminating
single-point failure and supplying continuous power even if one module of the entire
system were to fail.
The following table shows the number, installed capacity, and efficiency of the systems,
both before and after retrofits, across Infosys campuses in India :

The original UPS was designed for older computer systems, and is currently overdesigned considering the requirements of present-day computer systems. Earlier,
an additional back-up system was an inherent part of the system design aimed at
eliminating the possibility of data loss and maintaining business continuity. This
additional system would consume a substantial amount of energy, even when it was
not in use. With technological advancements, the modular UPS is designed with simple
independent systems that contain an optimum number of supporting elements.
UPS retrofits have reduced the installed capacity by 34% when compared to the
conventional system. Additionally, the modular system requires fewer batteries than
the old system. Owing to the elimination of the number of systems and equipment,
we have also witnessed a significant reduction in maintenance and related costs.

We have reduced our per capita fresh water consumption by 29.22% as of fiscal 2015,
as against the baseline figure for fiscal 2008 at our India locations.

The direct energy consumption within the Company takes place mainly through the
use of electricity, high-speed diesel used for generators and boilers, and the petrol and
diesel used in Company-owned vehicles, and lawn-mowers.
Based on the significance of the impact (with the 5% threshold we have defined) and
the potential for reductions that could be undertaken or influenced by the Company,
we do not have energy consumption outside our boundaries that is considered
relevant.

The direct energy consumed in our operations in various areas in fiscal 2015 at our
India locations is as follows :

Water consumption in the APAC region has been estimated based on the seating
capacity at these locations and per capita per month water consumption at our India
locations. The annual freshwater consumption in the APAC region is estimated at about
112,334 kl during fiscal 2015.

All the wastewater at our campuses is treated and reused for flushing, landscaping, and
in cooling towers. Our usage of treated water is also optimized through the use of dualflush toilets and sensor-based urinals. Owing to stringent wastewater recycling and
reuse systems, we have not released any significant amount of untreated wastewater
into the municipal sewage systems during fiscal 2015. The treated water quality is
monitored regularly to ensure our adherence to all applicable environmental norms.
The wastewater generated at some of our satellite offices contributing to less than 1%
of our overall wastewater is released into the municipal sewage systems.

Emissions

Restatements

The main emissions from our support activities include greenhouse gases (GHG),
sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other ODS. Emissions from the
stacks connected to generators, boilers and diesel-operated fire hydrant pumps are
monitored on a monthly basis.

The GHG emissions are computed for the three scopes based on the de minimis /
threshold values defined for Infosys. All categories of emissions which fall within 5%
of the overall emissions are considered to be significant and are reported.

GHG emissions
In line with the GHG Protocol, we have categorized our GHG emissions as direct and
indirect based on the following criteria :
•	 Direct GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by
the reporting entity.
•	 Indirect GHG emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the activities of
the reporting entity, but occur at sources owned or controlled by another entity.
•	 The GHG Protocol further categorizes these direct and indirect emissions into three
broad scopes — scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3.
•	 We use ‘Operation Control’ as the consolidation approach for emission calculation
and reporting.

The scope 3 emissions due to waste and LPG consumption fall below the threshold
and hence have been excluded from the total.
Two new categories that have been included based on the threshold defined are :
•	 Emissions due to the use of office equipment and computers, and
•	 Emissions due to transmission and distribution losses
Business travel : Given the high uncertainty associated with magnitude of the
additional environmental impacts of aviation, Infosys calculates the business travelrelated emissions based on the Defra emission factors for air travel, without radiative
forcing. It is also noted that all the Defra factors already include the distance uplift
factor of 8%. Hence, the calculations for arriving at the business travel-related emissions
have been revised to exclude the uplift factor. The changes have been applied to all
our past emissions data as well. The distance for business travel was reconciled based
on an audit of systems and processes.

Note : This section addresses the GRI G4-22 disclosure.
Our main sources of indirect GHG emissions include electricity consumption, fuel
consumption in food courts, business travel and employee commute.

the overall emissions are considered to be significant and are reported. The significant
emission categories for Infosys are as follows :

Total employee count = Average employee count (Infosys Limited and Infosys BPO
Limited) + count of contractual staff

Scope 1

SOx and NOx calculations
To arrive at the calculation of SOx and NOx emissions, the average emission rate,
running hours of diesel generators and boilers per month, and the oxides of sulphur
and nitrogen are first computed. The exhaust stacks are monitored for the net emission
calculation for the following :
•	 Concentration of SOx and NOx emissions
•	 Flow rate of exhaust gases
•	 Running hours of diesel generators (DG) and boilers
The following formulae are used for the final computation :
SOx = (SOx X Emission rate / 1,000) X (Running hours of DG and boilers)
NOx = (NOx X Emission rate / 1,000) X (Running hours of DG and boilers)

Energy
Our energy consumption within our operations is through electricity from grid, fuel
used in diesel generators and Company-owned vehicles and equipment. The energy
consumption outside the Company is through fuel used for both personal and
commercial vehicles used by our employees for daily commute to our offices and for
business travel, as well as fuel used in our food courts. The energy data is calculated by
using suitable conversion factors for electricity and various fuel sources, as defined in
the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment
Report.

GHG emissions
The GHG emissions are computed for the three scopes based on the de minimis /
threshold values defined for Infosys. All categories of emissions which fall within 5% of

Infosys Sustainability Report 2014-15

Stationary combustion
The total monthly quantity of high-speed diesel (fuel) combusted by diesel generators
and boilers is captured and used for the emission computation. The emission factor for
high-speed diesel is sourced from the IPCC 4th Assessment Report.
The total quantity of electricity generated in kWh at each site is sourced from energy
meters. The emissions due to onsite power generation from renewable sources such
as solar and wind are considered to be ‘zero’.

Mobile combustion
The total monthly quantity of diesel and petrol used by Company-owned vehicles and
lawn mowers is considered. The emission factor for diesel / petrol is sourced from the
IPCC 4th Assessment Report.

Fugitive emissions
HVAC systems are a basic requirement of our industry. Various refrigerants are used
for the air conditioners, each of which has a different global warming potential. The
total weight (in kg) of the refrigerant refilled during the service of air-conditioning
systems is captured from the service reports. This consolidated quantity based on the
different refrigerants is used for the GHG computation using emission factors sourced
from Defra.
Some of the electrical breakers installed at our campuses contain SF6, which might
be refilled during the course of maintenance. The information on the quantity of SF6
used for refilling the electrical breakers, if any, is collated from the service report, and
the total GHG emissions are computed using emission factors sourced from Defra.

During this year, the emissions due to employee commute have been estimated based
on the fuel efficiency, the total distance travelled and the fuel characteristics such
as NCV, density and emission factors for the fuel used, which have contributed to a
reduction in emissions.

If the food waste is more than 500 kg, a biogas plant is installed to treat the waste
and convert it to biogas, which is in turn used in the food court kitchen for cooking.
In addition to our biogas plants at our Mysuru, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar and
Mangaluru campuses for handling food waste, we are in the process of setting up
plants in Thiruvananthapuram and Pune. We also have organic waste converters at
our campuses in Thiruvananthapuram, Jaipur and Bengaluru. Paper waste is sent out
for recycling at our Bengaluru and Mysuru campuses. The vendor recycles the paper
and provides recycled products in return.

Waste management
We have been persistent in our efforts to ensure the reuse, recycling, and responsible
disposal of waste, and have adopted a scientific approach towards waste management.
As our business involves providing products, consultancy and services in the
information technology domain, our operations do not result in the release of any
significant waste, and also do not necessitate the use of any natural or recycled raw
materials for packaging goods and services. Our suppliers are encouraged to reuse the
packaging material used in the supply of goods to us.
Waste is segregated at source, stored and disposed to authorized recyclers, in
adherence to applicable legislations. Hazardous waste and e-waste are disposed to
recyclers, who possess the required clearances from the pollution control boards.
Infosys campuses have several large food courts to cater to the employees. The
food courts generate a considerable amount of food waste that include waste like
vegetable and fruit peels, etc., during cooking and cooked food wasted by employees.

Our initiatives on waste management are spread across three dimensions, namely,
influencing social behavior, process optimization and the implementation of
technology.

Influencing social behavior
Employee engagement and awareness programs are conducted across all campuses
through eco clubs, to sensitize employees on waste management and achieve

segregation at source. All the common areas and pantries on the campuses have colorcoded and labeled bins to ensure the segregation of waste. The following initiatives
are currently under way :
•	 To make segregation easier for employees, pantries and food courts across all
campuses will have a standardized green bin for wet waste and blue bin for dry
waste.
•	 Stickers with images to identify items that go into wet and dry waste bins have been
designed and are being printed for all campuses. These will educate employees on
waste segregation at source.
•	 Mailers and posters have been created to strengthen awareness and sensitize
employees about waste reduction.

Process optimization
The waste-generation patterns are continuously monitored at our campuses, and the
process of waste management is modified accordingly. The following are some of the
initiatives we have undertaken :
•	 We have initiated a detailed quantification of all kinds of waste, to help us analyze
and reduce waste.
•	 We have taken a corporate decision to ban all single-use plastic and paper tableware
(cups, spoons, plates and stirrers) from food courts. We have phased out disposable
cutlery at most of our campuses and replaced them with steel and glass cutlery, in
collaboration with our vendors. This has helped reduce the waste generated, and
has also made segregation easier for employees.
•	 We have standardized the design of our waste-storage yards, to enable better
segregation and storage, and in turn, enhance the recycle value of waste.
We did not have any significant spills during fiscal 2015.

Biodiversity
We are committed to conserving and promoting biodiversity at all of our owned
facilities, and we constantly encourage our employees and stakeholders to do the
same. We believe that rich biodiversity plays a vital role in creating a healthy and
sustainable environment. Last year, we made a commitment to plant 25,000 saplings
during fiscal 2015. In our continuous effort to maintain and increase the flora on our
campuses, we have already surpassed this number and have planted over 89,000

Our environmental performance

Nurseries maintained on our campuses
All our existing campuses are situated on government-approved land (industrial zones).
None of our campuses fall within or are adjacent to protected areas or high-biodiversity
areas, as notified in the siting guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and
Forests, Government of India. We also conduct environmental-impact assessment
studies for all new projects, wherever applicable, covering the impacts related to air,
water, social aspects, biodiversity, etc., within a 10-km radius of the proposed project
site.
We encourage our employees to protect and promote biodiversity. In our endeavor to
spread awareness on the significance of our ecosystem, we conduct nature walks on a
periodic basis on our campuses. This initiative provides insights to our employees on
the diverse and rich flora and fauna on our campuses.
We also proactively continue to organize sapling-plantation drives, with an emphasis
on native and endangered species. The larger aim is to sensitize our employees on the
protection and promotion of biodiversity.

While planting saplings, we ensure that we plant diverse species that are native to the
region. We also use a mix of saplings of various ages, ranging from one to four-anda-half years. Depending on the edaphic and climatological factors, we manage our
plantation with a density ranging from 170 trees per acre to 350 trees per acre. We
maintain nurseries at most of our locations, to ensure easy accessibility to them and
also ensure the adaptability of plants to the local surroundings.

INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT
Introduction

DNV GL represented by DNV GL Business Assurance India Private Limited (‘DNV GL’) has been commissioned by the management of
Infosys Limited (or ‘the Company’) to carry out an independent assurance engagement on the Company’s Sustainability Report 2014 -15
(‘the Report’) in its printed and web formats. This assurance engagement has been conducted against the DNV GL Protocol for Verification
of Sustainability Reporting (‘VeriSustain’ - available on request from www.dnvgl.com ). The verification was conducted during April-June’
2015, for the year of activities covered in the Report i.e. 1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015.
The intended users of this Assurance Statement are the management of the Company. The management of the Company is responsible
for all information provided in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analysing and reporting the information presented in the
printed and web based reports, including the maintenance and integrity of the website. Our responsibility regarding this verification is of the
non-financial – qualitative and quantitative information (Sustainability performance) disclosed in the Report only and in accordance with the
agreed scope of work with the management of the Company. The assurance engagement is based on the assumption that the data and
information provided to us is complete and true. We expressly disclaim any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or entity
would make based on this assurance statement.

Scope, Boundary and Limitations of Assurance

The scope of assurance includes the review of Economic, Environmental and Social Disclosures in the Report. In particular, the
assurance engagement included:
 Review the Report against the requirement of VeriSusatin with moderate level of assurance;
 The verification of the qualitative and quantitative information on sustainability performance disclosed in the report covering
Economic, Environmental and Social performance of the activities undertaken by the Company over the Reporting period
1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015 and based on the Global Reporting Initiative G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (GRI G4);
 Review of the policies, initiatives, practices and performance described in the Report including external references;
 Evaluation of the disclosed General and Specific Standard Disclosures for ‘in accordance’ - Comprehensive reporting
requirements covering the systems, and the processes which Infosys has in place for adherence to the Reporting Principles set
out in GRI G4;
 Confirmation of Sustainability Disclosures related to GRI G4 – ‘in accordance’- Comprehensive as declared by Infosys.
The reporting aspect boundary is based on the internal and external materiality assessment predominantly covering Infosys ‘Indian
Operations and Asia Pacific (APAC)’, including the key supply chain activities as set out in the report. During the assurance process, we
did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance engagement, except few disclosures related to remuneration which is
set out in the Report as sensitive and confidential and not reported. No external stakeholders were interviewed as part of this assurance
engagement.

Verification Methodology

This assurance engagement was planned and carried out in accordance with VeriSustain. The Report has been evaluated against the
principles of Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness, Reliability ,Completeness and Neutrality. As part of verification, we visited Infosys
Head Office at Bengaluru and Development Centres located in India i.e. Bengaluru (Electronic City), Hyderabad (SEZ), Bhubaneshwar and
Trivandrum (SEZ). During the Assurance Engagement, we adopted a risk based approach, i.e. we concentrated our verification efforts on
the issues of high material relevance to Infosys business and its key stakeholders.
As part of the engagement, we have verified the statements and claims made in the Report. In doing so, we have:
 Reviewed the Company’s approach to stakeholder engagement and its materiality determination process;
 Verified the sustainability-related statements and claims made in the Report and assessed the robustness of the data
management system, data accuracy, information flow and controls;
 Examined and reviewed documents, data and other information made available by the Company;
 Conducted in-person interviews with top and senior management team of Infosys and other representatives, including data
owners and decision-makers from different divisions and functions of the Company;
 Performed sample-based reviews of the mechanisms for implementing the Company’s sustainability related policies, as
described in the Report;
 Performed sample-based checks of the processes for generating, gathering and managing the quantitative data and qualitative
information included in the Report.

We have evaluated the Report’s adherence to the following principles on a scale of ‘Good’, ‘Acceptable’ and ‘Needs Improvement’:
Inclusivity: The stakeholder identification and engagement process includes engagement with key stakeholders to identify key
sustainability challenges and concerns through different channels and the process is matured. The material issues emerging from the
stakeholder engagement were collected and prioritized, and the results are fairly reflected in the Report. In our view, the level at which the
Report adheres to this principle is ‘Good’.
Materiality: The materiality determination process was revalidated based on inputs from key stakeholders including employees, clients,
investors, vendors/partners, governments, regulatory bodies, academia, local communities and senior management of Infosys.The Report
focusses its disclosures on key material aspects at macro level and has not missed out any known material aspects. The management of
Infosys Limited has established internal process for monitoring and management on a continual basis for their long term organisational
sustainability. In our opinion, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Good’.

Responsiveness: We consider that the Report has adequately disclosed the strategies and management approach related to identified
key sustainability aspects and challenges considering the overall sustainability context of the Information Technology sector. In our view,
the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Good’.
Reliability: The majority of data and information verified at the Head Office and four operational sites were found to be accurate. Some of
the data inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to transcription, interpretation and aggregation
errors and the errors have been communicated for correction. Hence in accordance with moderate level assurance engagement, we
conclude that the specified sustainability data and information presented in the Report is generally reliable. In our view, the level at which
the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Good’.
Completeness: The Report has fairly reported the General and Specific Standard Disclosures including the management approach,
monitoring systems and sustainability performances indicators against GRI G4 requirements corresponding to the ‘in accordance’ –
Comprehensive option. However, certain disclosures/performance indicators - internal and external to the Company for geo-locations
beyond Indian operations - are omitted and reason for omission were explained to us. The Company has confirmed that the systems for
aggregating data for these disclosures are being developed and set the internal time lines for disclosure. In our view, the level at which the
Report adheres to this principle is ‘Acceptable’.
Neutrality: The disclosures related to sustainability issues and performances are reported in a neutral tone, in terms of content and
presentation. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Good’.

Opportunities for Improvement

The following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities for improvement reported to the management of the Company and are
not considered for drawing our conclusions on the Report; however they are generally consistent with the management’s objectives:
 Sustainability performance may be disclosed at regular intervals for stakeholder to make informed decisions and benchmarked
with peers.
 The disclosue on management approach could consider disclosure on Aspect-specific DMA guidance to futher expalin the
management approach with respect to material aspects and dynamic business dimensions.
 The future Report may further expand disclosure on organisational sustainability impacts, and process of consultation between
stakeholder and highest governance bodies on environment and social topics, and its outcome.
