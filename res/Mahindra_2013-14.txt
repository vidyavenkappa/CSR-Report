of our future readiness.

BUSINESSWISE
This year, we commence the second leg
of our sustainability journey, wherein we
aim to create an even tighter ﬁt between
sustainability and our businesses.

Each business has raised the accountability bar. After
fresh engagement with their key stakeholders, they have
chalked out individual businesswise roadmaps which are
more focused, more relevant and more aligned to
emerging scenarios and expectations in their sector.

Message from
Chairman and Managing Director

We believe that when it comes to sustainability,
‘incrementalism’ is too slow. Now is the time to
embrace transformation fully and strategically at
a Group level. While small steps count, big leaps
are the order of the day and many of our businesses
have tried to do this.

Sustainability has come a long way in
the past decade, especially at
Mahindra. The question has changed
from 'why' to 'how'. It is now well
established that regenerative business
models are an imperative to thrive in
a global economy. The Mahindra
Group business leaders are now
asking, how they can create impactful
sustainability programmes that will
deliver returns on investment and
drive innovation across the business.
The ﬁrst leg of our journey has amply
demonstrated that the practice of
sustainability is not adversarial to
shareholder interests; rather, it
complements their goals. During this
ﬁrst learning phase, we targeted GHG
reduction and basic eco-efﬁciencies in
operations. We surpassed targets by
18 to 20%, with surprisingly nominal
investments and quick paybacks.
Gratifyingly, this earned us higher
ratings from analysts, who now look
at non-ﬁnancial parameters for
assessing the future valuation of
organisations.
During 2013-14, M&M Ltd. and
Mahindra Finance were selected as
index components of the Dow Jones
Sustainability Indices (DJSI), under
the Emerging Markets Index.
M&M Ltd. and Tech Mahindra also
featured in the list of top 10
companies in the Carbon Disclosure
Leadership (India) Index.

MReva took a paradigm leap into the world of electric mobility and introduced
to the nation a project of pride - the Mahindra Formula E-Car - an 'all-electric zero
emission race car'. We also unveiled the all new electric Maxximo and Verito Indias ﬁrst fully electric sedans. This year was a milestone year for our solar team
as MEPC became the largest solar EPC player in the country, with a total installed
capacity of 53 MWp. Mahindra Lifespaces ﬂagged off two affordable housing
projects in the country contributing to urban sustainability and the national goal
of a house for every Indian. Mahindra Finance facilitated the ease of owning a
house by providing doorstep housing ﬁnance. And the idea of fostering
sustainable business permeates all our strategic thinking.
We believe that true sustainability can be achieved only in a collaborative open
world. The enormity of the task dictates that no single entity, however large, can
successfully tackle the challenge. It requires collective brainpower of the
community to shape a sustainable future.
We have therefore instituted the Rise Prize with a purse of over USD 1 million to
encourage breakthrough and affordable innovation. Individuals discovering
potential solutions for the future of mobility and distributed renewable energy
will have the opportunity to be mentored by the world's foremost experts in the
ﬁeld. The IP will remain with the individual. Our role will be to provide a platform
for sharing ideas and help scale the idea to its true potential.
Our sustainability reports are crafted with the same philosophy of sharing. They
adhere to the highest levels of disclosure and detail our performance, policies and
processes. I urge you to read them, engage with us and let us know how we
could do better.
Sustainability is the biggest change management project of the century and the
only way we can move forward is together.

Message from
Chairman, Group Sustainability Council

Businesswise - this new approach
will steer individual businesses to
enhance the sphere of responsibility,
drive 'Alternative Thinking' across
the value chain and encourage each
business to seize new opportunities.

The ﬁrst step we took in our
Sustainability journey was to chart a
clear roadmap with deﬁned targets.
This provided all our businesses a
common launch pad for a
meaningful start. Not only did we
achieve all targets of this road map,
we surpassed most of them.
Encouraged by this, we decided to
raise the bar for the next roadmap
and accelerate our performance
across the environmental, social and
governance parameters.
The time was ripe to formulate
businesswise roadmaps, taking into
account material issues and unique
attributes of each business.
Hence this year, each business
strengthened its engagement with
key stakeholders, recorded
emerging issues, validated ongoing
expectations and articulated a time
bound roadmap with quantitative
targets. We also leveraged the
opportunity to commence the
process for migration to the G4
protocol, the new reporting
framework from GRI.
This new approach will steer
individual businesses to enhance the
sphere of responsibility, drive
'Alternative Thinking' across the
value chain and encourage each
business to seize new opportunities.

This will help us address emerging sustainability challenges at every level in the
organisation.
I am pleased to report that during the year, we continued to make progress
across various dimensions of sustainability. Twelve businesses logged a lower
speciﬁc energy consumption as compared to the previous year. H2Inﬁnity, the
360° water management programme, which we launched last year, has gained
traction. We have continued to develop products and services that have lower
environmental impacts and improved social empowerment. We continued our
focus on developing a clean and green supply chain, and continued to stand
true to our commitment to accountability, transparency and good governance.
All our successes to date have been made possible by the active engagement of
multiple stakeholders. As we embark on the next phase of our sustainability
journey, our targets are more ambitious and we intend to achieve them in
shorter time frames. This calls for disruptive transformation that challenges the
status quo. I believe that we at Mahindra are geared for it and look forward to
harmonise proﬁts with purpose.
With individual roadmaps, different businesses have chosen different paths,
best suited to them, with an aim to reach the same destination - a sustainable
enterprise. I wish them luck and success in this journey.

REPORTING PROCESS
Materiality

Report Boundary

As the aim of our initiatives gets
sharper, our ability to achieve the
target gets better. We endeavour to
drive a long-term positive change. But
to be truly effective, the change must
affect the most pressing of our
sustainability-related issues. The
process of materiality, at Mahindra,
not only distils the issues truly relevant
for us to be economically,
environmentally and socially
responsible, but also prioritizes them.

The reporting period for Mahindras seventh Sustainability Report is 1st April
2013 to 31st March 2014. As mentioned in our ﬁrst Sustainability Report in 200708, we remain committed to report our triple bottom line performance on an
annual basis.

Materiality is the threshold at which
an issue or indicator becomes
important enough to be reported.
Beyond this threshold, not all material
topics will be of equal importance and
the emphasis within a report reﬂects
the relative priority of these material
topics and indicators.
We are now preparing the
groundwork for reporting as per
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
Sustainability Reporting G4 Guidelines
that will be rolled out in the year
2015-16. The new guidelines are
proposed to have a keener focus on
'Materiality', with the aim to create a
report that is more strategic and more
focused in its interventions, solutions
and future plans.

Staying a step ahead, we
have already commenced
the incorporation of these
new aspects in our
Stakeholder Engagement
and Materiality
Identiﬁcation processes
for our future reports.

For this Report, we are following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
Sustainability Reporting G3.1 Guidelines. The most widely adopted non-ﬁnancial
reporting framework in the world, the GRI Guidelines are used to help
communicate sustainability performance and encourage transparency as well as
accountability. This year too, the Report is aligned to the nine principles of
Ministry of Corporate Affairs' National Voluntary Guidelines (NVG) on Social,
Environmental and Economic responsibilities of business.

CONCLUSION
Based on the 'work undertaken' in line with the 'Assurance Scope' and the 'limitations and exclusions', nothing has come to our
attention for us to believe that the Report does not meet the requirements of GRI principles and AA 1000 Accountability Principles
Standard for deﬁning report content and quality. Each principle is elaborated below:



Materiality
Mahindra has adopted a structured methodology for materiality assessment, followed by creation of measurable performance
indicators for prioritized material issues. The Report presents the sustainability roadmaps with deﬁned goals and targets for key
sectors. The methodology can be further evolved to ensure consistent application of stakeholder engagement outcomes as key
inputs to the development of sustainability roadmap by all sectors.



Stakeholder Inclusiveness
The Report fairly presents the various stakeholder engagement initiatives conducted during the reporting period.



Sustainability Context
As part of the report content development process, Mahindra has considered all relevant topics from a sustainability context. The
Report is aligned to the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business
published by Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India and United Nation's Global Compact Principles.



Completeness
This year Mahindra Powerol, Mahindra Shubhlabh Service and EPC Industrie Limited have been included in the report scope and
boundary. The performance discussion on material aspects identiﬁed in the Report appropriately covers the report boundary
disclosed in the Report.



Balance
This is a fairly balanced report which presents both the positive and the negative performance trends.

06



Comparability
The Report presents key sustainability performance indicators with a three-year trend for comparability. Appropriate sectorspeciﬁc denominators to report on the water, energy and GHG emissions intensities are used for different sectors.



Accuracy
The sustainability data and information presented in the Report have been collected, collated and analyzed by Mahindra's Group
Sustainability Cell. During the veriﬁcation visits data transcription and calculation errors were detected and resolved. Overall, the
data and information presented in the Report are within acceptable margins of error and along with appropriate presentation of
underlying assumptions and techniques.



Timeliness
Mahindra follows a regular schedule to publish the Report annually.



Clarity
The Report is structured to present the governance, materiality and stakeholder engagement used to deﬁne the report content,
followed by discussion on management approach and performance of economic, environmental and social performance. The
Report uses relevant graphs and consolidation with explanations where necessary, enabling readers to understand and interpret
the data.



Reliability
The collection and collation process for sustainability data and information at Mahindra is partly through an online portal and
partly through manual worksheets. The systems deployed for collection, collation and analysis of sustainability data and
information were reviewed at the site and sector level for the ﬁrst three quarters of the ﬁnancial year 2013-14 and at the corporate
level for all four quarters of the ﬁnancial year 2013-14. Overall, the sustainability data and information presented in the Report are
reliable.



GRI Application Level Check
The Report meets the A+ application level criteria as per GRI G3.1 guidelines.

INDEPENDENCE
Our work was performed in compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which requires,
among other requirements, that the members of the assurance team (practitioners) as well as the assurance ﬁrm (assurance provider)
be independent of the assurance client, including not being involved in writing the Report. The Code also includes detailed
requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, conﬁdentiality and professional
behaviour. KPMG has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance with the Code and to prevent conﬂicts regarding
independence.

RESPONSIBILITIES
Our responsibility is to express our conclusions in relation to the Assurance Scope listed above. We conducted our engagement with
a multidisciplinary team having necessary skills and experience in ISAE 3000, AA 1000 AS, stakeholder engagement, auditing
environmental, social and economic information and with experience in similar engagements. Mahindra is responsible for developing
the Report content. Mahindra is also responsible for identiﬁcation of material sustainability issues, establishing and maintaining
appropriate performance management and internal control systems and derivation of performance data reported.
This Assurance statement is made solely to Mahindra in accordance with the terms of our engagement. Our work has been undertaken
so that we might state to Mahindra those matters we have been engaged for. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone other than Mahindra for our work, for this statement, or for the conclusions we have reached. By
reading this statement, stakeholders agree and accept to the limitations and disclaimers mentioned above.

Corporate Governance
OVERVIEW

Shareholder Interaction:

Sound corporate governance is essential
for sustained growth. A good
governance structure, that is based on
transparency, integrity and
accountability, not only ensures robust
shareholder returns, but also enhances
operational performance and attracts
employees, clients and partners.

Multiple active communication modes
for our shareholders help us build
robust bridges of trust. We engage in
meaningful dialogues with our
shareholders across multiple
managerial levels via diverse channels
of communication.

The corporate governance philosophy
at Mahindra goes beyond enhancing
shareholder value. We remain
committed towards upholding industrybest practices while also ensuring ethical
wealth generation and being a
responsible corporate citizen.
Our commitment to corporate
governance has earned us a Level 1
rating for Governance and Value
Creation from CRISIL, India's leading
ratings, research, risk and policy advisory
company, for three years in a row.
Our Board of Directors, with their vast
experience and various industry-wide
achievements, lead us to contribute
positively to our stakeholders
prosperity. We inculcate good corporate
citizenship through environmental
awareness, ethical behaviour and
responsible business conduct. Be it
shareholders or our internal and
external stakeholders, we consider
ourselves accountable to them and
disclose practices beyond statutory
regulations.

SHAREHOLDER
VALUE
While generating value is imperative for
any business, generating enhanced
value, ethically, gives us the competitive
edge. Shareholders at Mahindra are not
mere recipients of beneﬁts accrued via
investments but are important channels
of valuable insight. Understanding
shareholders' expectations, aspirations
and in-depth feedback on our
performance help us navigate
comprehensive solutions that deliver
the maximum value for our investors.

The Chairman, along with the
entire board, addresses the
investors and provides clariﬁcations
at least once each year during the
Annual General Meeting, which is
the principal forum for face-to-face
interaction.
The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO)
regularly reaches out to investors
across the globe during investors
and analyst interactions (twice a
year) along with senior
management. In addition, there is
a dedicated Investor Relations Cell
to interact with the investors.
Our corporate website
www.mahindra.com provides
comprehensive information and an
exclusive Investor Relations
section which informs and
addresses shareholder needs. An
exclusive email ID
investors@mahindra.com has been
designated for the investors
towards registering complaints and
the same has been displayed on the
Companys website.
Furthermore, the quarterly,
half-yearly and yearly results are
published in national and local
dailies. Presentations are also made
to international and national
institutional investors and analysts
which are uploaded on the website
of the Company and available to all
stakeholders.
We also regularly post information
relating to ﬁnancial results and
shareholding pattern on Corporate
Filing and Dissemination System
viz. www.corpﬁling.co.in, the
common platform launched by BSE
and NSE for electronic ﬁling by
listed companies.

GOVERNANCE
FRAMEWORK
A robust governance framework is the
cornerstone of Mahindra Group. Our
Board comprises industry leaders with
extensive experience and multiple
achievements in diverse ﬁelds. At
every step, they guide the Group's
actions to enhance stakeholder
prosperity by upholding the highest
tenets of transparency and
accountability.
The governance framework brings all
our subsidiaries, associates and joint
ventures under its ambit and ﬁrmly
instils the Groups objectives in
everyday operations. It ensures
thorough monitoring of the
performance and spearheading
operational excellence.
The Group is categorised into ten
verticals. M&M Limited, the ﬂagship
company directly runs two businesses:
the Automotive Division and the Farm
Division; and is the chief shareholder
in all the other entities. In line with
legal requirements, companies in the
Group have their own independent
Boards of Directors, governance
structure and policies which align with
those of M&M. If they do not have
their own speciﬁcally deﬁned policies,
then they are expected to follow the
M&M policies.

understood and practised within the
organisation, a formal mechanism has
been put in place in the form of
'Corporate Governance Coordinators'
at the business level and 'Corporate
Governance Ofﬁcers' at the plant level.
These coordinators / ofﬁcers are like
'listening posts', where employees can
report irregularities noticed at the

SUSTAINABILITY AND US

Mahindra's Sustainability Evolution
From triple bottom line 'awareness' to 'action', from conservation 'potential' to 'performance', from 'responsibility' to
'ownership', from 'setting targets' to 'surpassing them', from 'incremental improvement to disruptive change - in this
sustainability journey of ours, 'Alternative Thinking' has empowered us to evolve at multiple levels.
Below are key milestones of our sustainability journey over the years:

Successfully cascading Sustainability
awareness across the entire organisation
A 360o awareness campaign to mainstream
Sustainability across the organisation, including
multi-disciplinary tools such as training
programmes, emailers, installations, posters,
celebrations, intranet, ﬁlm screenings, etc.
Embracing 'Alternative Thinking' as a
strategic approach to drive sustainability
into business decisions.

Spearheading strategic sustainability
initiatives at business and unit level
to achieve the set goals
Institutionalising sustainability across businesses
by establishing a group-wide sustainability
structure. Formulation and meticulous
implementation of sustainability SOPs.
Continued focus on capacity building and
knowledge enhancement around the
emerging dimensions of Sustainability
through regular workshops and speciﬁcally
tailored programmes. The number of
candidates trained, increased from 80 in
year 1, to over 250 during the reporting year.
Continually contributing 1% of Proﬁt After
Tax (PAT) to CSR initiatives annually since
2005 and encouraging employee volunteering
across businesses.

Formulating a structured
roadmap and setting measurable goals
Starting with a one-year roadmap to charting
out 3-year and 5-year roadmaps covering aspects
related to reduction in energy, GHG emissions,
water and waste, enhancing awareness among
signiﬁcant shareholders, improving the policy
framework related to procurement & supply chain
and receiving certiﬁcations for improvement in
Environment Management Systems.

purpose, with 'Alternative Thinking' being made one of the three
brand pillars. The other two being Accepting No Limits and
Driving Positive Change.

Sustainability 2.0
One of the countrys early sustainability
reporters, Mahindra Group ﬂagged off
its journey, seven years ago, by
introducing the concept of Sustainability
to our internal stakeholders and then
gradually enhancing the sphere of
inﬂuence to our external stakeholders.
Over the years, after consistently
evolving on our sustainability
performance - it was time to
signiﬁcantly raise the bar. It was time to
go beyond incremental improvement
and widen our sustainability horizon to
a whole new level.
Thus, after embedding the overall
framework of sustainability across
businesses, we are now progressing to
targeted Business-Wise sustainability
and as a ﬁrst step to enhance individual
accountability, we have formulated
customised business-speciﬁc roadmaps.
The aim is to enhance ownership and
accelerate penetration of Sustainability
within each business.

This is allowing us to:

Look deeper into existing
materiality issues as well
as address emerging issues
Align our sustainability
actions and disclosures in
line with newer
expectations of external
stakeholders like
governments, regulators
and investors
Champion sustainability
next practices such as
alignment with the G4
sustainability disclosures
framework through a
structured process

Realign our materiality with
stakeholder expectations
Make all our businesses
future-ready, enabling them
to make a larger impact
Move towards business-wise
reporting so that each
businesses can focus on
material issues and key
stakeholders, unique
to themselves
Benchmark each of
our businesses against
the best in their sector

Business-wise Roadmap Creation Process
Each business followed a structured and well-understood process, right from re-identiﬁcation of stakeholders to arriving at
key materiality issues which are aligned with business strategies, and accordingly customising sustainability targets:

CAPABILITY BUILDING
To ensure thoroughness of process and
enhance the quality of outcomes, the
Group Sustainability hosted customised
workshops for each business, to explain
and train them on how to identify and
prioritise each material issue, and map
their importance to the business as well
as the key stakeholders.

RE-IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITISING
STAKEHOLDERS & MATERIAL ISSUES
Each business individually undertook a structured three-step exercise, to refresh,
reﬁne and redeﬁne their sustainability focus, based on their respective business
vision & goals, and developed a Sustainability Agenda for the next 2 to 5 years.

REFRESH

REFINE

REDEFINE

With this in mind, the businesses
validated their stakeholder
identiﬁcation. To ensure efﬁciency,
businesses were encouraged to identify
not more than ﬁve key stakeholders.

Similarly material issues were listed out and a tool was provided to enable them
to map and prioritise those important to the business.
Data available for existing stakeholders was used to prioritise issues that would
be material to them. This became the basis for developing the Roadmap.

PRIMING UP FOR G4 STUDY
Across our reporting journey of 6 years, we have consistently demonstrated the highest degree of disclosure and all our reports
have been GRI checked A+. Keeping in line with our philosophy to push the reporting envelope, we have commenced our
migration to the newly introduced G4 Guidelines which encourage more strategic and focussed reporting, with a high degree of
emphasis on materiality and stakeholder engagement and would be reporting on the same in subsequent year. However, some
requirements under GRI G4 with regard to materiality and stakeholder engagement, supply chain management etc., have been
dovetailed in the new Business wise Roadmaps.

27

With G4, GRI has evolved its
sustainability reporting
guidelines with emphasis on
reporting only what is
material to the businesses and
their stakeholders. This will
result in reports that are more
strategic, more focused, more
credible, and easier for
stakeholders to navigate.

Moreover, in order to sharpen the focus on stakeholder engagement, this year,
we were audited for the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard (AA1000SES)
certiﬁcation.

The AA1000SES
provides a
framework to
help organisations
ensure that the
stakeholder engagement
processes are purpose driven,
robust and deliver results.

Training was imparted to the
Sustainability Champions and some
data owners across Group
Companies, so that they can meet
the expectations under the G4
Framework. The Sustainability
Council, was also sensitised on the
methodology and requirements of
G4, through a structured
presentation by KPMG, our
assurance provider.

ARTICULATING THE ROADMAP
After building the sustainability
capacity, re-identifying and prioritising
stakeholders & materiality issues, and
becoming G4 ready, each business
crystallised its individual Roadmap.

Identifying the commonalities of Material issues at the Group level
While the diversity of issues relevant to each business was sacrosanct, in order to
maintain a common pattern the material issues identiﬁed by all the businesses
were analysed.

It was noted that while the issues included in the roadmaps were different, they revolved around the following ve areas:

Eco-Efciency

Responsible Product Development

Targets were set around water
conservation, energy efﬁcacy,
biodiversity preservation, reduction
in waste generation and GHG
emissions etc.

Includes issues like customer safety,
reduced environmental footprint
during product's life cycle in the use
phase and product stewardship.

Green Supply Chain Management

Employee Care & Development

Encompassed training, audits,
effective packaging and logistics etc.

Community Development
Increased employee volunteering,
undertaking large-scale social
development projects, and
conducting need and impact
assessments.

Continuous improvement in health & safety standards, training &
development, and knowledge enhancement in varied ﬁelds of Sustainability.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUSINESS WISE ROADMAPS
Ownership of the new roadmaps lies
with the Senior Management, to
ensure continual focus and facilitation.
Being the ﬁrst individual Roadmaps
for businesses, periodic monitoring
and review mechanisms have been
instituted to enable quick course
correction if needed.
The expectations and concerns of key
stakeholders are changing at a rapid
pace, globally and nationally.
Therefore, pertinent revisions in the
materiality issues are imminent. To
accommodate them, the roadmaps
will be annually reviewed and

realigned to the current realities. This
will ensure that the roadmap remains
relevant at all times.
While roadmaps exist for all the
Group companies that are part of
the report scope, featured here are
roadmaps of those companies that
cumulatively contribute 85% of the
Group's turnover.
Besides the parameters, the base
line year and the time horizon for
each business have been set based
on the needs and aspirations of
individual businesses.

Below companies have also instituted
their individual sustainability roadmaps:

Two Wheeler Sector:
 Mahindra Two Wheelers Ltd. (MTWL)
Leisure & Hospitality Sector
 Mahindra Holidays &
Resorts India Ltd. (MHRIL)
Aftermarket Sector:

H2innity - A continuous commitment
Last year we ﬂagged off 'H2Inﬁnity', the 360o water management programme with an aim to bring about massive change in
the way water is consumed and conserved - not just within our operations, but by local communities, our vendors as well as
our customers.
In this initial phase, we are focussing on water conservation within our facilities and implementing interventions that reduce,
reuse, recycle and replenish. Water audits conducted at six Mahindra locations yielded signiﬁcant conservation opportunities
and many of them have already been implemented.

Stakeholder Engagement
Rather than just reacting to
concerns raised by stakeholders,
we constructively engage with
them, understand their needs and
interests, and inculcate their inputs
in our decision-making process.
The greater our interaction with
stakeholders, the better is our
understanding of their
expectations. Hence, we are
creating a wider engagement
canvas encompassing stakeholders,
right from investors to customers,
employees to communities and
suppliers to dealers.
We strategically employ diverse
dialogue platforms to access
multiple perspectives and the
concerns of the multitude.

Group-wide stakeholder engagement mechanisms:
All our businesses regularly engage with all stakeholders through diverse platforms.
A list of these is mentioned here, in reference to the respective stakeholder group:

incredible expeditions. Alongside providing adventure delight to its customers,
this unique initiative also showcases the off-roading capabilities and on-road
qualities of Mahindra vehicles. It is also a very apt platform to receive feedback
from the actual users as well as experts in the automotive ﬁeld.
This year Mahindra Adventure raised the bar.
In the 'Mahindra 'Monsoon Challenge 2013', Mahindra
vehicles traversed the challenging route from Bengaluru
to Goa, becoming one of India's biggest TSD (Time, Speed,

an integral part of our stakeholder engagement manifesto and we proactively engage with them at multiple levels:

Creating 'Sustainable' Suppliers | AD
We organised a Sustainability Awareness and Training workshop to embed
sustainability culture in our suppliers. Conducted in two phases - the ﬁrst batch

DEALERS
Dealers form the vital cog between us and our customers. A dealer is the 'direct point of contact' for our customers and
hence it is very important to engage with our dealers and seed in them the Mahindra ethos. Some of the platforms for
interaction this year were:

Effective Technology. Efcient Information. | MTWL
Our new IT-enabled Dealer Management Service (DMS) is an excellent
information sharing tool that connects all MTWL dealers through a common
platform. A revenue-based model, DMS enables over 200 dealers to access
secured information about day-to-day sales, spares and service transactions,
company news and industry knowledge, along with related reports.

Good Skills. Better Service. | AD
Competitions not only bring out the best in an individual, but also motivate to
sharpen one's skills. In the reporting year, AD organised 'Mahindra Idols' and
'Ustaadon Ke Ustaad' wherein 27,539 dealers were assessed at different levels.
Methodologies for assessments included case studies, situation-based responses,
interviews, vehicle diagnostics and group activities. The 48 winners were
felicitated at a gala award ceremony in the presence of industry stalwarts and
Mahindra executives.

Encouraging Aptitude | FD
'Mahindra Star' is a Dealer Recognition Programme launched by Farm Division to
reward the star performing salesmen and technicians working in FD dealerships.

DRIVEN BY OUR PEOPLE
Introduction

Management Approach

Talent makes the world go round. It
stares at the face of challenges and
sees opportunities hiding underneath.
It seeks to go that extra mile which
connects customer satisfaction and
delight. It is the vital ingredient that
differentiates seemingly
homogeneous organisations involved
in similar ﬁelds of business and using
the same forms of technology.

To attract, nurture and retain talent, we deploy the following two constructs:
adherence and aspiration. As a Group, we adhere by our three Rise pillars Accepting No Limits, Alternative Thinking and Driving Positive Change, and aspire
to be one of the Top 50 most admired global brands by 2021.

In today's world, talent is
precious; and yet it is
abundant. It is there in
each one of us; waiting
for the right set of
circumstances and
conducive environment
to catalyse it into motion.
At Mahindra, we seek to provide an
environment that discovers, incubates,
nourishes, rewards and retains talent.
Because we understand that at the end
of the day, we as a Group are only as
good as the people we employ.
We enable and enrich every individual
associated with us, by providing
freedom to innovate and opportunities
to put ideas into practice. Across all our
businesses, we have well-designed and,
more importantly, well-executed
learning programmes. While leveraging
the potential of our people, we also
ensure that they are protected by a
robust health and safety policy.
Over the years, we have understood the
beneﬁts of gamiﬁcation in the process
of bringing out the best in people.
Mahindra Rise Awards and Mahindra
Safety Awards invoke a positive
competitive spirit among our businesses,
manufacturing units and employees.
As we have grown and ﬂourished as a
Group, so have our employees. But we
strongly believe that it is true, the other
way round.

Our HR policy is derived from contemporary practices in Talent Management and
Leadership Development, and has been formulated with an aim to create leaders
across hierarchies and businesses, and build a thriving culture of meritocracy and
co-creation.
Our Human Resource Development function operates through a two tier
framework - one at the Group level and other at the Business level. Working
together in concert, these two levels guide and nurture our employees towards
individual and organisational growth.

THE GROUP LEVEL HR
Helps create a federation that is driven by purpose and is futuristic in its
outlook to create tomorrows company. In this endeavour, Group HR cocreates with the businesses, next generation practices in people management
and governance to build a culture of excellence.
Provides thought leadership in the ﬁeld of human capital, and brings in
appropriate tools and methodologies so as to create an organisational climate
where Mahindra renaissance leaders can achieve accelerated growth. Towards
this goal, Group HR facilitates creation of Centres of Excellence.
Is the custodian of cutting-edge practices in talent management and
leadership development across the Group.

THE BUSINESS LEVEL HR
Ensures alignment with the Group HR philosophy and rolls out customised
employee initiatives for their respective businesses.
Manage routine processes for their businesses like employee performance
management, industrial relations, recruitment, training & development,
employee engagement, employee satisfaction surveys etc.
41

LABOUR PRACTICES
Every seed must get its required share
of water and sunshine in order to
ﬂourish to the best of its potential. We
follow the same philosophy and
provide equal and ample
opportunities to all our employees.
Discrimination or biases, in any form,
are unacceptable. We ensure
adherence to all the labour legislations
and facilitate safe & healthy working
conditions for our workforce. Our
'Corporate HR Cell' charts norms,
policies and initiatives to ensure a
consistent approach across our
business segments.
All units of AD, FD, Systech and MIL
are OHSAS certiﬁed, except the
recently commissioned Zaheerabad
unit of FD, which too is in the
advanced stage of obtaining OHSAS
certiﬁcation.
Under our strategic employee upgradation programme, all our
employees periodically undergo
training and remain updated with
contemporary best practices. We
recognise and support the right to
collective bargaining.
In 2001, we became one of the ﬁrst
Indian companies to be a signatory to
the United Nations Global Compact
(UNGC) and we remain dedicated to
operate in sync with its principles on
labour standards.
PRINCIPLE 3
Businesses should uphold the freedom
of association and the effective
recognition of the right to collective
bargaining
PRINCIPLE 4
The elimination of all forms of forced
and compulsory labour
PRINCIPLE 5
The effective abolition of child labour
PRINCIPLE 6
The elimination of discrimination in
respect of employment and

International Labour Organisation's
core labour conventions into our
policies:

HUMAN RIGHTS
At Mahindra, Human Rights is a nonnegotiable premise. We place utmost
importance on upholding the dignity
of every individual associated with us.
Any acts of discrimination, forced &
compulsory labour and child labour,
be it within or beyond Mahindra
boundaries, are denounced. We also
discourage moral & monetary
corruption and remain vigilant that
they do not inﬁltrate our premises.
In May 2009, we formally incorporated
the 10th Principle of UNGC in our
Human Rights Policy.

In order to harness the
synergy of diversity and
collaboration, Mahindra
has incorporated a
Diversity Council. This
Group Diversity Council,
comprising senior level
executives from across the
Group Companies, will
meet at regular intervals
to device ways and means
to bring forth diverse
perspectives cutting across
gender, physical abilities
and race. Sector-level
Diversity Councils have
also been set up to derive
a roadmap for driving the
agenda of diversity in their
Sectors and to cascade
the policies of the Group
Diversity Council.

Talent Management
Talent Management, at Mahindra, goes beyond just identifying and attracting the
right talent; it is also about developing, nurturing and rewarding existing talent. It
is our comprehensive approach to enable every individual associated with us to Rise
and thereby amplify our potential to consistently deliver excellence.

Harvard Manage Mentor - Rewards and Recognition
The Harvard Manage Mentor (HMM) - Rewards and
Recognition competition is a unique inter-sectoral
competition that aims to gauge the extent to which
participants have integrated programme learnings in their
professional lives. During the competitions, held in
Februrary 2014 at Mumbai, 11 individuals and 2 teams
showcased the various ways in which they had implemented
their learnings in real-life scenarios. Attractive prizes such as
training programme sponsorships and holidays were
awarded to winners.

This year our Group HR designed and
delivered the 'Early Leaders'
programme and the 'Emerging
Leaders' programme, in-house. Earlier,
both were undertaken in partnership
with Centre for Creative Leadership
(CCL). The Early Leaders programme
had 25 participants and the Emerging
Leaders programme had 26
participants from ﬁve sectors. The
programmes covered topics like
Knowing Thyself, Impacting Others,
Leading Change and Internalising
Learning. Psychometric tools, various

deployed to provide a blended
learning experience.

Reective
Conversations
Reﬂective practice gives an
organisation the ability to introspect
and engage in continuous learning.
The Group HR conceptualised and
rolled out the Reﬂective Conversations
Skill Building Workshop, in July 2013,
in partnership with the CCL. 75 senior
executives from various businesses,
including members of the Group
Executive Board (GEB), participated in
these workshops.

with the value that they can expect in return.
Last year, Automotive & Farm Equipment Sector pioneered the concept of
Employee Value Proposition in Mahindra and this year, Mahindra Finance
embraced it with an aim to reinforce its position as a preferred employer in
the Finance sector.
The following parameters emerged from a study undertaken between
April-June 2012, to discover the Employee Value Proposition (EVP) of
Mahindra Finance:
Being customer centric;
reaching our customers directly

Pioneering the use of IT
to cater to rural customers

De-risking the Treasury and
maintaining Asset Liability
Management (ALM)

Unleashing the
passion of our people through
capability building

way of life

2

Employees are
empowered

3

People
Matter

This EVP was then released pan-India on 1st of November, 2013,
across all ofces of Mahindra Finance.

Health & Safety
The road towards absolute safety is
ever-changing and never-ending. It
is also a path of continuous learning.
During the reporting period, there
were two fatalities amongst our
contractual workers. These
unfortunate incidents made us
realise that, as far as safety is
concerned, one cannot rest on past
laurels. They also gave us important
learnings that have helped us make
our operations and processes, safer
and more employee-friendly.
Our commitment to safety and
health of our employees remains
ﬁrm. And while we are analysing
and learning from the past, we are
also forging ahead by continuing
with our safety Kaizens and PokaYoke exercises, and introducing new
initiative and practices.

CENTRAL SAFETY COUNCIL
In order to make safety a collective and collaborative effort, we established a
Central Safety Council two years back, consisting of representatives from all our
sectors. The Council regularly takes stock of the safety initiatives and programmes
across the Group, and also deliberate to improve safety levels.
Broadly, the Council creates a forum which functions to fulﬁl following objectives:

1

Improving safety awareness
Sharing best practices for ensuring safety
Promoting proactive measures to prevent accidents and
occupational hazards
Rewarding and recognising commendable achievements
Regularly brieﬁng the Group Executive Board on safety performance

In 2011, the Central Safety
Council instituted the Mahindra
Safety Award to create a
competitive spirit within the
Group by recognising and
rewarding commendable
achievements by various plants,
leading to an improved safety
culture.
The Award also recognises
achievement in the ﬁeld of
environmental and social
sustainability.
Every year, based on the

Fatality

Fatality Reporting
During 2013-14, there were two unfortunate cases of fatality; one, as a result of a
fall from the roof while undertaking repair work at the Zaheerabad unit of AD;
and another, due to improper handling of H-frame while constructing a
scaffolding at MLDL's Iris Court site in Chennai.
A comprehensive 'Root Cause Analysis' was conducted for both the losses, based
on which the following preventive measures have been implemented:

At Zaheerabad unit, AD:

Serious Diseases
We regularly communicate the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle, and share knowledge amongst our employees,
their families and our surrounding communities on how to prevent diseases. This helps us maintain a healthy, satisﬁed and
stable workforce.
Few of the many diseases which we address include:
Gynaecology Issues, HIV and AIDS, Orthopaedic Issues, Breast Cancer, Cancer, Swine Flu, Hepatitis B, Thallaesemia,
Malnutrition, Polio, H1N1, Seasonal Fever and Jaundice, Rubella Vaccination, Diabetic Detection, Hypertension, Cataract,
Polio, ENT, Dengue, Malaria and other epidemic diseases.

INITIATIVES
MGTPL
Auto Indexing Safety
in Grinding Machines
Workers working on root grinding
machines run the risk of injury due to
their hand coming in contact with
the grinding wheel or due to
breakage of the grinding wheel. This
is mainly due to the non-existence of
a guard in the root grinding machine
and manual indexing of the
component.

MGTPL
Reducing Finger Injuries
in Machining Operations

MLL
Yoga Wellness
MLL undertook 'Yoga Sessions @
Work' to help employees enrich
their professional and personal
lives. These hourly sessions are held
once a week.

With an objective of embedding
safety in operations and providing
better working conditions to the
workers, Mahindra Gears and
Transmissions Pvt. Ltd. introduced
new safety features in root grinding
machines. An auto indexing wheel
was added to the machine,
eliminating operator intervention to
rotate the component. Also a guard
was provided to the root grinding
wheel to make it safer for the
operator. The interventions
eliminated risk and allowed a single
operator to run two machines at a
time, which also increased
productivity by 10%.

We believe that all injuries are
preventable. In order to keep ﬁnger
injuries at bay during the removal
of burr from the machines,
Mahindra Gears and Transmissions
Pvt. Ltd. introduced a new
deburring device 'Deuburring
Chakki'. The new device helps cut
down the manual process of
removing unwanted pieces of
material created after the
machining process.
In the absence of the device,
operator's hands were directly
exposed to the risk of burrs and the
blade. This was the cause of 79% of
ﬁnger injuries. Since the
implementation of the new device,
ﬁnger injuries more than halved
from 11 injuries per month in FY 13
to just 5 injuries in FY 14. Based on
the concept of ice-crusher, this
compact device is being deployed in
other cells too. The operators are
being trained to use this device by
production engineers.

Mahindra Institute of Quality (MIQ)
designed and delivered, a customised
and comprehensive training
programme, 'Essentials of Safety at
EPC Projects and Operational Sites',
at Phalodi, Rajasthan. 37 participants
including GETs, Site Engineers,
Supervisors, Senior Engineers and
Assistant Managers attended this
two-day programme, which covered
numerous topics ranging from
behavioural safety to electrical
safety, and safety in Operations &
Maintenance.

Dexterity for Safety

AD
Ensuring Employee Comfort
A number of initiatives were taken to make the
workplace at AD, Igatpuri more comfortable for the
employees. These include:
An ergonomic analysis study was conducted; resulting
in bend-free assembly lines
Introduction of acoustic enclosures for DG sets and
engine test cabins, and provision of ear muffs reduced
noise by 25 dB
AC roof sheets were replaced with bare galvalum sheets
and glass wool; resulting in a temperature drop of 4oC

Attaining dexterity not only makes equipment easier to
use, but also safer to use. During the reporting year, AD
Igatpuri held a Safety Dexterity Workshop for ofﬁcers
and new trainees. Experiential training was provided for
using safety shoes and controlling ﬁre incidents more
effectively.
The participants were also shown how to use both
hands and ﬁngers safely, for undertaking certain kind of
processes.

A MITRA in Need:
Mahindra In-Time Response and Assistance Helpline

INTERVENTION

OUTCOME

Safety and security of the employees is of a paramount importance to the
Mahindra Group. In order to support employees and their spouses during
unforeseen emergencies, Mahindra Group launched a voluntary initiative
called MITRA (Mahindra In-Time Response and Assistance) helpline. The
objective of the helpline is to provide registered employees and their
spouses support in case of medical emergency, crime / assault, accident,
vehicle break-down and police liaison requirement.

MITRA, which means friend in
Hindi, is surely turning out to be
a friend in need for employees
and their spouses. With 1400
employees already reaping its
beneﬁts, it has witnessed a
laudable response. Buoyed by
this response, we have extended
this helpline for all Mahindra
Group employees and their
spouses based in Mumbai region.

The helpline was launched on Independence Day and was piloted for all the
employees of the Mahindra Towers, Mumbai. The service was also extended
to spouses of registered employees of the Corporate Centre.
The actual response on ground (i.e. vehicle, medical staff, police liaison) is
provided by partners, whom the Group has engaged. The software (mobile
& web application) is designed by Group Security & developed by Tech
Mahindra. The control room is designed & manned by Group Security.

SUCCESS STORIES
Ms. Kritika Kapoor (name changed) placed a frantic call to MITRA around 7
am. She had just returned from her hometown and had forgotten her
handbag in the rickshaw which she had boarded from the railway station.
Her handbag contained her house keys, cash and her credit & debit cards.
The MITRA team swung into action and in less than 15 minutes, a team of
ﬁrst responders reached her society. A key maker was found and duplicate
keys made for her ﬂat. MITRA helped her in blocking her credit & debit
cards too. A team of liaison ofﬁcers reached her home by 9 am to help her
ﬁle a complaint with the authorities. Though her hand bag could not be
found, Kritika was greatly relieved to receive prompt support from the
MITRA team in her time of crisis.

WOW - Wealth of Wellness

Ganesh Desai (name changed)
was on his way to the ofﬁce
and his vehicle stalled on the
Chinchpokli Flyover. He raised
an assistance alert from the
MITRA App and immediately
received a call from MITRA.
A tow truck with trained staff
reached the site within half an
hour and towed the vehicle to
the service centre.

Introducing a technology that cuts fuel consumption
in DG sets by 20%

CHALLENGE

INTERVENTION

There are more than 375,000 telecom
towers in India, majority of which run
on diesel generators at a constant
speed, irrespective of the load
demand. This process leads to higher
fuel consumption which comes to
8,760 litres of diesel consumption per
year per tower.

In spirit with our sustainability
philosophy of Alternative Thinking,
Mahindra Powerol introduced a
technology that radically reduces the
fuel need in a Diesel Generator (DG).

In the year 2012 alone, the telecom
sector was responsible for 7 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.
India is expected to have 1 billion
mobile phone subscribers by 2015,
which would mean about 250,000
more mobile towers being added and
projected emission close to 30 million
tonnes CO2. This quantum of increase
in emissions is not just sharp but also
alarming.

Majority of the telecom sites run diesel
generators at a constant speed
irrespective of the load demand.
Mahindra Powerol identiﬁed this
setback and introduced the eFSS
module that enables variable speed
operations of its diesel generators.
This leads to lesser diesel consumption,
and thereby lesser emissions and
lower operational costs.
Mahindra Powerol is the leading
manufacturer of diesel generators in
the Telecom sector, and hence this
breakthrough will empower us to
largely contribute in reducing the
emissions in telecom industry.
One of the added beneﬁts of this
technology is that it has wide
applicability. It can be deployed in
new or refurbished DGs as well as can
be retroﬁtted on any engine / DG for
both outdoor or indoor sites.

CASE STUDY

Plans are in place
to introduce this
fuel-efcient
technology for
diesel generators in industries beyond
telecom, nationally
and globally.

A ﬁrst in the industry, this technology
features smart speed regulation with
intelligent load sensing, smart
controller and tamper-proof hour
meter. Optional features include
remote monitoring, digital fuel
monitoring system, integrated SMPS
and AMF functionality for new sites.
The eFSS module also allows
centralised monitoring of all the sites
through GPS / GPRS and the creation
of a separate ID for customers to
analyse parameters like fuel
consumption. Till date, 100 telecom
sites have already adopted the eFSS
technology.

BENEFITS
Enhanced resource efciency and
Reduced carbon footprint
Fuel consumption can be reduced by 18% over
ﬁxed speed Diesel Generator
Even if only 25,000 of the telecom sites turn to
eFSS, there would be a collective saving of 11.6
million gallons of diesel each year

Lower operating cost and
enhanced functionality
Before eFSS

After eFSS

Each telecom site consumed
approximately 8,760 liters of fuel per
year, amounting to approx. $8,500 (as per
current diesel prices of $.97/liter) of
expenditure to the telecom operator

After the installation
of eFSS, same site
consumes about 7,000
litres annually, thus
saving about $1,700

Best proposal for waste disposal

CASE STUDY

BACKGROUND
Every year, end-of-life vehicles generate between 8 and 9 million tonnes of waste in the European Union. To tackle this
problem, a Directive encouraging vehicle and component manufacturers to design products with reusability, recyclability
and recoverability (RRR) in mind, was proposed and has been adopted.

The Directive includes the following provisions:

It is estimated that
some 75% of a
vehicle (mainly the
metallic content) is
currently recycled.

The remaining
25%, which mostly
comprises of
plastic, glass,
rubber, foam and
contaminants,
is generally
considered either
unsuitable or
uneconomic for
recycling.

1

Economic operators (this term includes producers, dismantlers and
shredders among others) are to establish adequate systems for the
collection of ELVs - passenger cars and light commercial vehicles

2

Current reuse, recycling and recovery targets that must be met by
economic operators are 85% recovery with 80% as a minimum for recycling
and increased targets from 2015 are 95% recovery with a minimum of
85% recycling

3
4

Restrict use of heavy metals such as Lead, Hexavalent Chromium, Mercury
& Cadmium to in new vehicles
Producer to be responsible for establishing collection systems to take back
end-of-life vehicles, and the arrangements for meeting re-use, recycling
and recovery targets

INTERVENTION
ELV / RRR requirements for present European Export Vehicle variants was made
part of the Mahindra Product Development Systems (MPDS). A vehicle recycling
strategy was drawn up, to streamline the vehicle recovery process for compliance
with RRR directive. This strategy involves inclusion of agreed measures right from
developmental stage of the vehicle, to ensure successful achieving of target
85% recycling and 95% recovery rates.
Working groups have been constituted to deal with restrictions on the heavy
metals in products exported to European Union. Measures are in place to collect
appropriate data through the full supply chain, (in particular the nature and the
mass of all materials used in the construction of the vehicles), manage the
breakdown of materials and ensure that no component part listed in Annex V of
RRR Directive is used in construction of new vehicles.
A number of standards have been mandated to be followed during the vehicle
developmental stage and for providing detailed speciﬁcations about ELV / RRR
requirements. M&M has also devised a list of Raw Material Codes, which are
being incorporated in the PLM systems, so as to understand the material content
and gauge approximate recyclability level of the vehicle during the preproduction stage itself.
Dismantling information for safe handling of end-of-life vehicles and sound
material recovery has been freely made available on Mahindra's website www.mahindra-tis.com, for the beneﬁt of dismantling agencies.

HARNESSING GREENER ALTERNATIVES
In India about 400 million people,
more than the combined population
of the US and Canada, lack access to
electricity. While tapping the power
of sun is an obvious solution  it is
important to do so in a sustainable
fashion.
At Mahindra, we build solar power
plants that incur 'lower' cost of

production and yield 'higher' returns
on investments. We execute large-scale
solar plants within record time, while
ensuring adherence to demanding
quality standards in every aspect of
project execution.
This year, was a milestone year for our
solar team as Mahindra EPC (MEPC)
became the largest solar EPC player in

the country with a total installed
capacity of more than 85 MWp. The
Company was also recognised by the
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
(MNRE), Government of India and the
nodal agency for Phase I of the JNNSM
 NVVN (Jawaharlal Nehru National
Solar Mission  NTPC Vidyut Vyapar
Nigam), for speedy commissioning of
solar power projects.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS
Expanding Footprints

Replacing diesel with solar power

Mahindra EPC successfully
commissioned 23 MWp and 30 MWp
Solar PV Projects in Bikaner and
Jodhpur respectively. Both these solar
PV power plants are built to supply
more than 85 million units of clean
and green energy per year and are
expected to mitigate nearly 71,000
metric tonnes of CO2 annually.

DG sets are a high-cost power generation option, not only from an
environmental point of view, but also from an economic view point. The
ﬁnancials make them unattractive for segments like residences, small ofﬁces,
and inns.
To cater to this unfulﬁlled need, the MEPC has designed a proprietary solar
generator that can provide up to 2kW of power - enough to run a 1 HP (750W)
water pump, a 200W refrigerator, a 50W television set, two 40W light bulbs and
two 60W fans concurrently.

Adding to existing 2 MW off-grid
projects, MEPC commissioned a
118 kWp solar rooftop power plant
for Infosys in Chennai.

Its sleek, compact design also includes a 5 kWh battery backup which can also be
charged by the grid during cloudy days. The generator works silently, produces
zero emissions, and has the ability to export power where net metering power is
permitted.

Sun on the run
Mahindra's solar-powered CCTV
camera project on the 90 km JaipurAjmer National Highway was

NEW DEVELOPMENTS
Arjun Ultra 1 DLX launched in Punjab
Arjun Ultra 1 DLX is India's ﬁrst Multi Application Tractor (MAT) in >50 HP
category. It offers a 4-cylinder, powerful and reliable MKM engine with
best-in-class fuel efﬁciency and its button operated hydraulic system enables
farmers to lift large weights, quickly and comfortably.

Swaraj, now even in Sandy Soil
Swaraj has added one more feather in its portfolio by launching the
Swaraj 841XM within Gujarat and Rajasthan. This tractor is designed to perform
efﬁciently even in loose and sandy soil and sports the unique Sensilift Hydraulics.

Unnati in Agriculture
Mahindra Agribusiness introduced Unnati Single Super Phosphate (SSP)  an
indigenously produced fertiliser, by upcycling Hazardous Sulphuric Acid, which is
a by-product of the Detergent / Mineral industry. It not only mitigates imports,
but also facilitates waste management and reduces the burden on the efﬂuent
treatment plant.

The Potato Special
Mahindra Tractors launched its new 35 HP tractor, the Mahindra 265 DI Power
Plus - Potato Special. The tractor has an adjustable track width, which is extremely
critical for potato farming as the potato tubers are planted at different widths,
based on the farming practices prevalent in that region. It is a powerful, fuel
efﬁcient and versatile new-age tractor with revolutionary and technologically
advanced HyTEC Hydraulics, ideal for potato farming and lifting heavy loads.

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC INNOVATIONS
At Mahindra, we believe that happy customers equal a happy bottom line. Hence
we continually bring forth innovations that cater to demand gaps and desires of our
customers. We don't shy away from offering smallest of economic services, if they
can bring a smile on our customers face.
In fact, at the Blue Chip conference held in Cape Town, Mr. Anand Mahindra, the
Chairman of Mahindra Group, unveiled a new micro innovation initiative to drive
home the message that each and every member of the Mahindra Group needs to
think about how they can innovate.

Learning from our innovations
To innovate smartly it is essential to focus on innovations which have failed and learn from them. We therefore
celebrate genuine innovations even though they might have failed in gaining a foothold.
In 2011, we instituted 'Failed Innovations Award' to recognise that learning from failures also leads to success.
Below is the proud winner for the year 2013.

Infrastructure & Real Estate for their innovation 360° curing and waterproong
To cure water seepage in construction materials, this innovation employed nanotechnology. A surface is created
on the material to make it waterproof. Though this innovation passed most tests for waterprooﬁng, it did not get
satisfactory results for the test which involved compressive strength on concrete. However, it can be used as a
waterprooﬁng agent on tiles and other surfaces.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Overview
India's growth story is replete with irony. FY 2014 was a testament of the same. In
a year that saw a near-perfect monsoon season and record agricultural output,
India's manufacturing sphere still witnessed its worst performance in two
decades. The overall GDP growth too dropped below ﬁve percent for the second
ﬁscal year in a row. However, with economic recovery in developed countries,
coupled with growing international demand for Indian goods and stabilisation of
the Rupee, we believe that we have witnessed the darkest hour before dawn and
look forward to a slow but steady turnaround.
Despite having extensive business interests that straddle both industrial and
agricultural sectors, majority of the Mahindra Group Companies maintained a
healthy growth in both business and proﬁts. But the vagaries of nature and
eccentricities of market sentiments cannot be discounted altogether. So while the
Farm Division (including Swaraj Division) showed a robust sales growth of 19.4%,
Automotive Division showed a de-growth of 10.2% and 4.8% in vehicle and
three-wheeler sales respectively.
Similarly, while subsidiary companies like Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services
Limited, buoyed by judicious control over transaction costs and high collection
efﬁciency, registered a growth of 28.9% in consolidated income, Mahindra
Lifespace Developers Limited showed a consolidated proﬁt after tax after
minority interest of INR 1,006.3 million as compared to INR 1,413.7 million in the
previous year.

Management Approach
Years of deep thinking and sustainability reporting have ensured that ecological
and ethnographic aspects are an intrinsic part of all our economic considerations.
Mahindra Group Companies continue to explore business opportunities, while
being sensitive to the needs of the people and the planet.

Mahindra & Mahindra
recently received a Credit
Rating upgrade to AAA,
the highest level by India
Ratings & Research, the
domestic arm of global
ratings agency, Fitch.
The ﬁrm assigned a Long
Term Issuer rating of 'Ind
AAA' with a stable
outlook to M&M. This
stands testament to the
Company's resilience in
economic cycles across last
18 years, its strong market
position, meaningful
diversiﬁcation activities,
effective product
development strategies,
and conservative ﬁnancial
policies.

Our extensive business interests in alternative energy and technology sectors
allow us to pave the way towards a better future. While Mahindra EPC continues
to commission bigger and more efﬁcient solar power plants at a faster rate,
Mahindra Reva's Future of Mobility concept seeks to encompass the

5Cs framework of Clean, Convenient, Connected,
Clever and Cost-effective vehicle technology
Innovation is one of the key tools that enables us to achieve responsible business
excellence. Over the years, we have continued to invest signiﬁcantly in R&D - the
establishment of the world-class Mahindra Research Valley in the previous year,
created at an investment of INR 650 crore and home to over 1,500 engineers and
designers, is a case in point.
The aim is to build on our culture of innovation and unveil products and services
which are both disruptive and sustainable, enabling India to Rise.

Financial Implication of Climate Change
No business is weather-proof. Adverse climate can impact a business operation just as
signiﬁcantly as an adverse business operation can impact the climate. Our businesses
cover both manufacturing and agricultural sectors, and are hence even more
susceptible to temperamental weathers.
Although we have institutionalised wide-ranging initiatives to keep our carbon
footprint under check, we also appreciate the fact that there is only so much that we
can do as an individual organisation. Hence, we take part in diverse national and
international think tanks, councils and advisory bodies to effect a larger and more
long-term positive change.

Mahindra Group is a part of the TERI BCSD forum. TERI-BCSD helps incorporate sustainability into the business
strategy of companies by providing advisory and connecting corporates with other stakeholders.

This year, one of our companies, Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel Pvt. Ltd. (MSSSPL) became a founding member of India
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Program. The Program is a new industry-led, voluntary initiative, spearheaded by the World
Resources Institute (WRI)-India, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

MSSSPL also became one of the only two Indian businesses making a representation at The Warsaw
Climate Change Conference 2013. A delegation from the Company took part in the nineteenth session
of the Conference of the Parties (COP 19). Key decisions adopted at this conference include decisions
on further advancing the Durban Platform, the Green Climate Fund and Long-Term Finance, the
Warsaw Framework for REDD Plus, and the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage.

While we strive to contribute towards resisting the climate change, we have also adapted to its adverse impacts by adopting
various measures - right from getting the right supply of our raw materials to ensuring the right demand of our product, right
from adopting the right technology which is favourable to nature to equipping our operations with right infrastructure.
We realise that climate change impacts not only our businesses, but also our stakeholders. Hence, we engage with relevant
stakeholders and mentor them on climate risk and sustainable practices that will help mitigate this risk.

Local supply
At Mahindra, when we say that we are an Indian Multinational, the emphasis lies
more on the word 'Indian'. The country has given us immense opportunities to
grow and we take it as our prerogative to give back in kind. Encouraging local
supply is just one such means. Giving local supply a shot in the arm not only
makes great business sense owing to the reduced transportation cost and faster
deliveries, it also provides a global platform for local manufacturers to exhibit
their products, services and proﬁciencies.
That being said, we would not want our customer's user experience to be
dampened by our enthusiasm towards local suppliers. Hence, we have a stringent
process of identifying and empanelling only the most promising suppliers. Some
of the factors inﬂuencing supplier selection include:

Cost

Performance and
on-time delivery

Compliance on environment,
health and safety guidelines

Commitment to reduce
the carbon footprint

Statutory
requirements

There are some other factors which can inﬂuence the decision to opt for
international suppliers like beneﬁts from SEZ, favourable taxes and import duties
schemes as compared to local market procurement. But in such cases, the route of
policy mandate maintains a fair balance.
Although the boundaries of India remain the de facto deﬁnition of local supply
for most of our businesses, a few of them have more focussed perimeter.
Mahindra World City, Jaipur makes it a point to source from within a 500 km
radius while Systech Gears' units at Chakan and Kanhe have a 300 km radius limit
for procurement.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

Overview
Energy continues to remain a priority
focus area across the Group. Address
energy and you not only address
emissions, you also address costs. Not
only do you enhance environmental
performance, you also enhance cost
competitiveness. Hence we doggedly
continue to ferret and implement
energy-saving initiatives. We are
aware that as we inch towards
optimum energy consumption, the
quantum of energy savings that we

can squeeze out every year will
decrease, but that does not dilute our
focus. On the contrary, it eggs us on to
look for more innovative methods and
push the boundaries of Alternative
Thinking.

the water equation across the group.
Under the aegis of H2Inﬁnity, we have
initiated comprehensive and longterm programmes and initiatives
towards making our businesses more
water-friendly.

With energy conservation and
optimisation being mainstreamed
across a majority of our businesses, we
have sharpened our focus on Water
and ﬂagged off a transformatory
programme - H2Inﬁnity, to change

In addition to energy and water, we
continue to arrest our emissions,
enhance our waste management, and
devise innovative ways to do more
with less.

Management Approach
We consider environmental efﬁciency
as a business competency and invest
time and money to enhance this
efﬁciency. Alternative Thinking
continues to enable us to unearth
effective ways of conserving and
optimising the ﬁnite natural resources
bequeathed to us.
Within our manufacturing facilities,
we encourage sustainable innovations,
embed value engineering in processes
and seed green consciousness in our

We strongly believe that
ecology and economics are
not contradictory, but
complementary to each other.
people. Beyond the boundaries of our
manufacturing facilities, we undertake
comprehensive interventional projects
that inculcate the tenets of water
conservation in rural India and provide

better access to life and livelihood for
the local population.
While we have embedded
sustainability within all our Group
companies and are steadily driving
each ﬁrm and manufacturing facility
to enhance their performance each
year, we are also concentrating on
individual high-impact material issues
that affect each and every Group
company.

Environment Policies
Environment management at
Mahindra is based upon and guided
by a well-thought-out and elucidated
Environmental Policy. Originally
formulated for M&M Limited, the
policy has been cascaded across the
Group Companies. Its objectives are to
reduce the organisation's carbon and
ecological footprint, maintain balance
in the eco-system, and create longlasting value for business and society.
For our Environment Policy; please
refer to Sustainability Report 2009-10.

In order to complement the Environmental Policy and make it more
inclusive, we have also instituted following policies.

GREEN SUPPLY CHAIN
MANAGEMENT POLICY
Having seeded sustainability within
our operations, we have gone a step
ahead to enhance the sustainability
quotient of our suppliers. Towards this
objective, we engage with our
suppliers and vendors on a regular
basis through a steady stream of
green initiatives.

GREEN IT GUIDELINES
Mahindra formulated its Green IT
guidelines in 2008-09 to govern
proper sourcing, management and
disposal of IT equipment. Today, all
the Group IT agencies and users are
committed to adhere to these
guidelines.

INITIATIVES
Green Supply Chain initiatives at FD

The Farm Division continues to collaborate
with its suppliers in an effort to make them
more environmentally sustainable. During
the reporting year, our initiatives included:

Setting up a fume extraction system with
wet scrubber, for removal of carbon and
other pollutants from fumes.

Guidance for implementing
rainwater harvesting system
and optimising water usage.

Upcycling of scrapped wood by
converting them into pallets
and boxes for packaging.

Through sustained collaborations with the suppliers, FD has managed to bring down wood consumption (in kg used
per unit of production) from 16 kg/tractor manufactured in FY 09 to 7.8 kg/tractor manufactured produced in FY 14.
Similarly during the same period, the consumption of corrugated boxes has come down from 27 kg/tractor
manufactured to 17.4 kg/tractor manufactured.

Seeding a sustainable SCM at MSSSPL
The 4th annual Supply Chain Management workshop at MSSSPL was conducted
in October 2013 under the theme: 'Sustainable Supply Chain Meet - SSCM 4.0'.
The theme aimed to depict the wider scope and the changing paradigms of
sustainable SCM. The workshop included sessions on:
MSSSPL’s Vision,
Policy and
Roadmap for
SSCM (FY13-FY18)

Discussion and sharing
of expectations on the
Code of Conduct for
MSSSPL’s suppliers

Supplier presentations
highlighting the
sustainability initiative
at their locations

Presentations made by external
organisations like KPMG (on G4
guidelines) and BSI (on BS 8903
Sustainable Supply chain Standard)

A total of 52 delegates including 15 Tier 1 suppliers and members from Mahindra Systech companies, attended the workshop.

Celebrating World Environment Day with Dealers
AFS celebrated the sustainability month at 316 dealer workshop locations. Activities included free PUC camps for
customers, displaying WED posters, giving away handouts on fuel-saving tips, road rallies and contests.

Environmental Management
At Mahindra we manage our
environmental footprint through a
comprehensive process which
addresses issues ranging from waste
management to emission reduction
and from reusable packaging options
to balancing biodiversity. We deploy a
combination of large transformatory
interventions and a bouquet of small
initiatives that may be vapid if seen in
isolation but are potentially gamechanging when cascaded across
businesses and scaled up beyond plant
boundaries.
Our years of sustainability reporting
has helped us ﬁne hone our

In the reporting period, we spent a total of INR 932.10 lac

environment management skills. The
constant monitoring has helped us
gain deeper insights into relationships
of cause and effect. It has ingrained in
us the importance of seeding
sustainability at the design stage. Our
organisation-wide carbon and water
footprinting exercise, continues to
help us prioritise interventions.

Every reaction demands an action;
every effect requires a cause, and
every impact involves an investment.
Year after year, we invest towards
enhancing our environmental
performance.

Amount

We measure our environmental
performance on absolute as well as
speciﬁc consumption. As part of the
reporting process the speciﬁc
consumption is calculated by dividing
absolute consumption by a
denominator based on the nature of
business. For instance, in case of
manufacturing business units it is
number of units produced, for
services it is number of employees, or
units of services offered etc.

AIR QUALITY
Of the ﬁve basic elements of nature,
air engulfs us most comprehensively.
Naturally, the importance of good air
quality cannot be understated. As a
global conglomerate with major
presence in automotive, we adhere to
major statutory emission norms and
have streamlined monitoring
mechanisms to keep a check on
various pollutants on a regular basis.
In line with the revised National
Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS 2009), the Particulate Matter

(size less than 10 µm), (size less than
2.5µm), Sulphur Oxides (SOX) and
Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) are commonly
monitored at all the manufacturing
and services locations. Some
manufacturing plants also monitor
more speciﬁc pollutants related to
their processes like Respirable
Suspended particulate Matter (RSPM),
Carbon monoxide (CO), Methane
(CH4), Ozone (O3), Lead (Pb) among
others.

OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES
The perils of Ozone-depleting
Substances (ODS) have been known
for more than three decades now.
They have been identiﬁed, classiﬁed
and mandated to be entirely
discontinued as per Montreal Protocol.
Mahindra seeks to play a responsible
role by keeping its actions Ozonefriendly. We have incorporated
regulation on emission of

Ozone-depleting Substances like
chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFC), Halons and
Hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs),
and have implemented multiple
processes in our Environmental
Management programmes to
substantially reduce the use of ODS.
In 2013-14, the Non-ODS (R134a)

CASE STUDY

Green Logistics at MLL
Even a small change made in a large and important process can result
in a major impact.

When Mahindra Logistics Ltd. (MLL) embarked
on a journey to reduce the intensity of GHG
emissions, it started where it mattered most –
transportation which contributes more than
80% of MLL's revenue.

Network
Optimisation

New Fleet
Induction

Load
Optimisation

Alternative
Fuel

Vehicle
Optimisation

Alternative
Mode of
Transport

As part of a sustained programme to reduce GHG emissions in transportation,
the following initiatives were undertaken:

NETWORK OPTIMISATION
Aggregating the loads across the transportation network of
MLL and ensuring that the right type of vehicle is deployed
to meet the aggregated load, without compromising the
service level deliverables of adhering to timelines and
ensuring damage-free deliveries.
The inbound logistics of Automotive Division were taken up
as a pilot. A thorough study in terms of volume and
frequency was conducted and an appropriate network

comprising four Cross Docks (Consolidation /
Deconsolidation centres) was established to handle these
loads in an optimum manner. The outcome was
deployment of higher capacity vehicles with full utilisation
levels. This led to lower fuel consumption per unit, which
not only resulted in a major GHG reduction but
manifested in savings of 363,658 litres of diesel per
annum. Plans are underway to cascade this drive to FES
and other major customers of MLL as well.

92

LOAD AND VEHICLE OPTIMISATION
Redesigning the vehicle and other
logistical equipment to maximise the
capacity utilisation of the vehicle.
Under the vehicle optimisation
programme, to accomodate more
units and ﬁxtures in the vehicle, the
trailer body and the packaging have

been redesigned, wherever required.
Under the load optimisation
programme, the loads are decided
for a shipment based on minimum
idle time and dead runs of the
vehicle, this leads to fuel
optimisation.

Through these two optimisation
drives across the various MLL units
at AD and FD, the fuel
consumption has gone down by
425,586 litres/year and GHG
emissions have been curtailed by
1,191.64 tons/year.

ALTERNATIVE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION & FUEL

NEW FLEET INDUCTION

In order to further reduce GHG
emissions, MLL has started
dispatching long distance goods
through rail instead of road. During
the year, MLL saved 17,906 tonne of
CO2, by using rail transportation.

As part of this initiative, MLL has
initiated the process of replacing
older vehicles with newer ones,
that are more fuel-efﬁcient and
meet new-age emission norms.
Against a target of 2% of vehicles
to be replaced, MLL replaced 7%
of its vehicles within the prescribed
age brackets for vehicle types.

As a pilot, electrically-operated
Reva cars were also deployed for
inter-facility transportation at one
of the customer premises. The same

is being replicated at more
customer premises.
To give a larger impetus to
alternative fuels, MLL is interacting
with local authorities to deploy
CNG commercial vehicles in the
Mumbai to Nashik-IgatpuriChakan corridor so that CNG can
be ﬁlled in Mumbai for these trips.

INITIATIVES
Paperless Productivity at MMFSL
The Personal Loan Application Processing (PLAP)
facilitates capturing of personal loan enquiries at
source and at every stage till approval / rejection
of the application; thereby completely bypassing
the use of paper-based stationery and reducing
the Scope 3 emission gures.
The PLAP can also perform the de-dupe function
by syncing with E-Parichay and identifying
existing customer using ﬁngerprints. It is a core
application engine integrated with various
applications like collection handheld, two-way
messaging, open source web application, and
customer communication etc.

Conveyance Claim Module
is an integrated module to
process conveyance
reimbursement payments to
the ﬁeld force. It maintains
an MIS on productivity,
efﬁciency and performance
comparison across period,
for approving authority.
It is a completely paperless
process that even frees the
ﬁeld force from the need to
maintain manual records of
local travels.

MSSSPL rst steel company to join India GHG Programme
A new industry led, voluntary programme called India GHG
Programme, spearheaded by the World Resources Institute
(WRI)-India, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), was launched in July 2013
at New Delhi. Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel Pvt. Ltd. (MSSSPL)
has joined this programme as a founding member company.

Biodiversity
PROJECT HARIYALI
Project Hariyali has been our ﬂagship endeavour towards nurturing biodiversity.
Initiated in 2007 with an objective to plant one million trees in a year, this
initiative has been surpassing its target every year.

During reporting period, the Group planted
1,492,646 trees through the combined efforts of its
employees and community partners.
We are fully aware that plantation is just the ﬁrst step in the long journey, from
saplings to the trees. Hence we continuously nurture them, monitor them and
replant new ones in place of those that wither away.

Mahindra Hariyali:
1 Million Tree
Plantation in FY14.

INITIATIVES
A Deer Park in the midst of a Tech Park
The Tech Mahindra campus in Hyderabad has a unique feature that sets
it apart from all the campuses in India's hi-tech city - a deer park.
The deer park was founded in 1997 and is, today, home to 18 deers and
more than 8 species of birds. The zoo is Government recognised under
Section 38H of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 issued by CZA (Central
Zoo Authority). Tech Mahindra takes special care of all animal species
with help of skilled veterinary ofﬁcers.

The Araku Hariyali Project: Three Millionth Tree
The valley of Araku, nestled in the northeast region of
Andhra Pradesh, is home to various adivasi tribal
groups. In spite of globalisation and accelerated
development in India, the lives of the adivasis have not
changed. To help alleviate this problem, Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd., the Danone (Fund for Nature) and the

Naandi Foundation initiated the Araku Hariyali Project
in 2010.
In partnership with the Adivasi Community, the project
team helps them create their own portfolio of fruit and
forest trees that will sustain a healthy carbon rich
ecosystem. The goal is to plant six million trees across a
terrain of 6,000 hectares by 2015. This horticulture
project will positively impact the lives of over 60,000
people residing in 300 villages.
On 19th March 2014, three millionth sapling was
planted by Mr. Rajeev Dubey - President (Group HR,
Corporate Services & After-Market) & Member of the
Group Executive Board, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.

Automotive Division, Mumbai

CASE STUDY

CHALLENGE
Energy consumption
was affecting the
bottom lines of AD's
Kandivli Plant.
INTERVENTION
An intensive study was conducted at the Plant and the thermopac oven was found to be the highest fuel consuming
equipment, i.e. around 1,800 m3 PNG per day. After intensive analysis of all the feasible solutions, it was decided that the
best route would be to recover waste heat for preheating of combustion air, so that the oven would consume less fuel.
For this, a Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger (HPHE), a lightweight compact heat recovery system was pressed into service.
It comprises a sealed container, a capillary wick structure and a working fluid. The benefits:

Lowers the power requirements and increases
the overall thermal efficiency of the system

Capable of operating at 315° with
60% to 80% heat recovery capability

Maintenance free, zero

OTHER SECTORAL INITIATIVES
Hinoday, Urse
Over-achieving energy targets

During the reporting period, MHIL, Urse over-achieved its energy saving targets
of 854 kWh/LMT by achieving savings of 892 kWh/LMT in October 2013 itself.
A host of initiatives were carried out to achieve this success, of which the key ones are listed here:
Compressor energy
consumption reduced
by 425 kWh per day

Elimination of machine cooling
tower & pump resulted in
savings of 150 kWh per day

Rainwater harvesting helped save energy
required for pumping river water

Melting utility
energy reduced by
400 kWh per day

Auto shut-off
timers for Fume
extraction blowers

Electrical heating of Dust Collector heater banks converted to LPG
heating, resulting in energy savings of up to 5,000 units per day

Furnace cooling coil raw water pump impeller was trimmed to optimise its functioning and thereby reduce power
consumption. This resulted in a saving of 120,000 kWh per year and annual monetary savings of INR 10.8 lac

Sharing green practices, Groupwide
Bluing makes the steel corrosion-resistant
and increases its interlaminar resistance.
Traditionally, the process had been
plagued by three issues: high-processing
cost owing to use of LPG, the inherent
danger in operating a boiler on the shop
ﬂoor, and non-uniform bluing.

After much deliberation, the team at MIL,
Kanhe decided to create a homogenous
atmosphere of Exo-gas and moisture by
controlling the dew point of Exo-gas at
generation. As a result of this, there was no
need to provide extra steam / water for Bluing.
Also, there was no need for a boiler now.

This new process uses
7 kg of LPG less per hour
compared to earlier process;
resulting in fuel savings of
168 kg per day and cost
savings of INR 13,440 per
day (@ INR 80/kg).

Water Consumption by Sector

Manufacturing Sectors

A key learning from the crisis in
Maharashtra during 2012, was that
water shortage not only affects farm
productivity, but it is also detrimental
to industrial output. Thus at
Mahindra, we have undertaken a
water footprinting exercise and our
conservation initiatives range from
harvesting to replenishing and
recharging to recycling.

DISCHARGED WATER QUALITY
We maintain zero discharge of wastewater pollutants and periodically monitor the quality of discharged water via internal
and external agencies. The values have always been found to be within the guidelines and limits, defined by the State
Pollution Control Boards and local regulatory authorities.

Enhancing the Value of Wastewater with Bio-Sanitiser

CASE STUDY

CHALLENGE
The Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at MSSCL's Kanhe facility was using the
conventional methodology of adding chemicals for treating sewage, and
power operated agitators. There was a continuous odour emanating not just
from the STP but also from the treated water. This foul smell rendered the
treated water unusable, even for gardening purpose. Thus, the energy and
resources spent on the wastewater recycling were going down the drain.

INTERVENTION
For any environmental measure to be truly sustainable, it needs to be based on sound economics.
After a series of discussions with Group Sustainability, alternative ecotechnology was adopted in place of conventional
technology. The STP was retrofitted with a Bio-Sanitizer. Developed in India, this treatment, once placed in the flow of
wastewater, can aerate and treat the sewage without any recurring costs like power, additional machinery or chemicals.
This oxygen-rich water also becomes a resource for eco-sanitation.
The project was initiated in March 2013 and completed in May 2013, in phases.
Stage-wise

Bypassing Sand and
Graphite filters

Switching off Agitators / Aerators in
old STP tank after few days to allow
stabilisation of system

Dosing in treated
water storage tank

Testing the water quality
at regular intervals

OUTCOME
After installation of the bio-sanitiser, following outcomes have been achieved:

POWER SAVINGS

COST SAVING

40 units of electricity is being saved
every day; leading to savings of
INR 95,000 per year

The annual maintenance contract
is no longer required; leading to
savings of INR 2.88 lac

SAFETY OF WATER

ENHANCED USABILITY

No chemicals are being
used at the STP

The treated water is now odourless. It can be used in
gardening and thus, there is no need to order tankers.

A second phase is now under execution for further improvements like eliminating suspended solids, and enhancing the
capacity of storing treated water. Additionally, a template has now been created for other units and Group Companies to
study and emulate.

Water Management - The Mahindra Way
Mahindra Institute of Quality (MIQ)
and Group Sustainability have
continued their journey towards water
conservation by conducting the
second batch of training programme 'Water Management - The Mahindra
Way', in March 2014.
The programme covered key topics
related to Water - Global & India
Scenario, Audits & Accounting,

Demand Management, Distribution
and Pumping, Stakeholder Perspective
towards Sustainability, Statutory
requirements, Quality parameters,
Treatment Approaches, Watershed
Management at Damoh, Rainwater
Harvesting and sharing of best
practices from Zaheerabad and
Igatpuri. The participants also visited
the AD plant at Nashik to understand
the processes used to achieve over

50% reduction in water usage in the
past few years.
27 participants from various M&M
businesses attended the programme.
In addition to Mahindra employees,
the programme was also open to
students and administration ofﬁcers
from Mahindra United World College
of India (MUWCI) and suppliers of
Group companies.

WATER CONSERVATION INITIATIVES AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS
SFD
Innovative RO Plant

Systech
Channelising Rainwater

Swaraj Plant 2 withdraws approximately
4 lac litres of groundwater per day for
production, domestic cooling,
housekeeping and gardening, etc.
Continuing its commitment towards
sustainability and green manufacturing
practices, it has installed a Reverse
Osmosis (RO) Plant with a capacity of 1.5
lac litres per day, whereby 1 lac litres per
day of treated wastewater will be
channelled back into the process (for
production / cooling etc.).

In order to channelise the freely
ﬂowing rainwater from behind the
NL-0 plant of Systech's Urse Foundry
Unit, a bund was constructed and a
pipeline was laid to safely extract
the water and use it for Plant's
consumption. The total cost of
constructing the bund and
procuring the motor and pipes came
to INR 61,000. Today, the Unit gets
approx. 180,000 litres of rainwater
every day during monsoon at the
cost of INR 360 per day, against an
earlier cost of INR 3,078 per day to
extract the water using pumps.

A unique feature of this plant is that
instead of disposing the reject water
(RO reject) in evaporation unit as
practised in other units, this Plant will
reuse it for gardening / plantation after
mixing it with treated sewage
wastewater. A similar RO plant has also
been set up at AD, Kandivli.

MUWCI
Water Management Project
Mahindra United World College of India (MUWCI) is an international preuniversity residential college located on a 180-acre biodiversity reserve outside
of Pune, India. In view of its dependence on Mula river as its primary source of
water and high per capita water consumption, MUWCI initiated a number of
water conservation measures.

240 million litres of rainwater can
be channelised every year, through
an intricate network of continuous
contour trenches and check dams,
to recharge groundwater

Sustained rainwater harvesting
measures, largely utilising
existing buildings and storm
drainage network, have resulted
in saving of 4,000 KL of water

To supplement an existing STP, a more eco-friendly STP was introduced in
2014. It treats 20 KLD grey water from cafeteria, without any chemicals.
This water is then used for irrigating the Campus' Wada 5 garden

Integrated Watershed
Management Project - An Update
The Integrated Watershed Management Project is a ﬁve-year comprehensive
intervention programme spearheaded by FES, spanning environmental and
social bottom lines. On completion, it is slated to drive positive change in the
lives of more than 20,000 villagers spread across 32 villages of Damoh district in
Madhya Pradesh.

Water conservation continued to
remain a key focus at MUSCO,
Nashik where the following
initiatives were implemented during
the reporting period.

The project, initiated in 2012, covers a multitude of initiatives ranging from
better management of water, mobilising community through formation of
community-based organisations, increasing area under cultivation, and
enhancing the overall quality of life through enhanced livelihood opportunities.

KLD in FY 13.

AD, Nashik
Enhancing the use of
harvested rainwater

With an aim to become a water-neutral unit, AD Nashik initiated following
interventions.
At the paint shop ASU, the humidity
was previously being controlled by
throttling of pump delivery through
motorised valve. Now, it is being
maintained through VFD on ASU
pump. This initiative saves 300 m3
of water annually.

All domestic wastewater now
treated at the STP and utilised for
gardening. The unit also installed
three rain guns in garden.

The Hydro MPC system for
compressor will save 1,500 m3
per year.
Natural draught for compressor
saves 1,800 m3 per year.
On the shop ﬂoor, previously
radiators were being ﬁlled
with water manually.
An automatic ﬁlling system
(including scanning of vehicle
model) will save 110 m3
of water per annum.
Installation of skid sensors
to control the spray ring
operation will save 2,700 m3
per annum.
Water usage has been reduced
in the canteens; leading to
annual saving of 2,100 m3.

Since 2009, a total of 51 projects have been initiated at the Unit.
Together, they save 286,345 m3 of water and INR 52 lac every year.

On analysing the water consumption
data of the Nashik unit of AD, it was
found that while 33% of the Plant's
water requirement was fulﬁlled by
treated water from the STP, the rest
67% was being sourced as raw water
from MIDC. In order to achieve its
goal of becoming a water-neutral
unit, AD Nashik decided to form
a Cross-functional Team (CFT) to
increase rainwater harvesting.
Towards this, following steps
were undertaken:
A pond to store 3,500 m3 of water
was made at an unused bare land
1/3rd area of the plant has been
covered under the catchment area
of the pond
Domestic tanks of 500 m3 capacity
were installed instead of RCC tanks
Three innovative collapsible
storage tanks of 25 m3 capacity
each, were installed
Since May 2013, the usage of
the harvested rainwater has
increased by 21 times.

105

Comprehensive Water Conservation at AD, Igatpuri

CASE STUDY

Usually, the value of water is only realised when it becomes scarce. AD, Igatpuri understood the importance of water
and initiated proactive measures, based on four broad aspects, to ensure judicious and continued use of water:

Accounting and monitoring
Cross functional teams were formed and water meters were installed at all prominent locations. Detailed
water audit was done to identify areas of high water consumption.

Changing process and addressing abnormalities
Abnormalities like leaking water lines, frequently overflowing cooling tower tanks and unusually frequent
cleaning schedules were identified and addressed.

Recycle and reuse
Encouraged the use of treated wastewater and installed bio filter plants and root-zone technology STP to
treat canteen waste and domestic sewage respectively.

Rainwater harvesting
Special arrangements were made to harvest the rainwater from the rooftops of various manufacturing
locations of Igatpuri.
Not wanting to stop at just bringing
down the consumption of water, AD
Igatpuri also analysed the resource
pattern for water usage. It found that
a large quantity of alternative water,
sourced from ETP/STP or rainwater
harvesting, was being used for
landscaping. In order to balance the
water mix and channel more water
for plant requirement, following
processes were implemented:
Proper rationing of alternative
water
Promoting the principles of
Xeriscaping and planting native
plant species
The geographical and geological
attributes of Igatpuri plant presented
unique challenges and opportunities.
While the hilly terrain made
transportation of water difﬁcult and
costly, the rocky topography and
slopes show less percolation and are
more suited for harvesting the
rainwater that was otherwise just
ﬂowing away.

Two locations with V-shaped valleys
and good water retention potentials
were identiﬁed and a large, shallow
catchment area was developed in a
cost-effective manner
An existing abandoned quarry was
also identiﬁed for its water storage
potential

Through these measures,
the AD Igatpuri's specic
water consumption has
reduced by 66.7% since
FY 07.

The water conservation spirit of AD
Igatpuri goes beyond its plant
boundaries. In order to alleviate the
water scarcity problem of the local
residents owing to long summers and
low catchment levels of the local
Talegaon dam, around 50 regular
employees & contract employees from
the Unit helped the city residents
construct a new bund and lay
pipelines. Through these measures,
the proposed catchment increased to
2,400 kl/day.

In all, two artiﬁcial lakes
were created to store
approx. 29,000 kl of
rainwater.

Replenishment of the Kolavai lake
Mahindra World City, Chennai

CASE STUDY

CHALLENGE
Spread across 802 hectares with a capacity to hold nearly 476 million cubic feet of water, Kolavai lake is the lifeline of
Mahindra World City, Chennai. As the lake is located in a rocky region, the ground water recharge is not much. This
makes it essential to restore the lake to sustain water quality in the surrounding villages.

INTERVENTION
MWC, Chennai has taken up the task of
replenishing the lake via rainwater harvesting
and stormwater management. A network of
stormwater drains has been constructed along
all the roads & buildings connected to the lake.

The total run-off from roof and non-roof areas
3
is over 15,000 m /day and 100% of stormwater
run-off is diverted to the lake.

Restoration measures such as de-silting, de-weeding, solid waste management, capacity restoration, strengthening of
embankments and erosion control have been taken up. A common STP arrests wastewater flowing into the lake.

OUTCOME
Water levels are maintained in the Lake through
out the year. Groundwater levels and water
quality has been enhanced in the surrounding
villages. The rejuvenated Kolavai Lake has also
restored its pride as a tourist attraction.

Benchmarking an evergreen landscape
Mahindra World City, Jaipur

CASE STUDY

CHALLENGE
A landscape designed to inspire, struggled to survive the intense climate at MWCJ. A startling number of withered
saplings indicated that the team needed to think afresh.

INTERVENTION
Existing plants were replaced with select plants suitable for the region.
With renewed efforts, the garden once again started blooming with small
shrubs. However, the cost of procurement of these new species was very
high as these were not available in the local market. To counter this, the
team established an in-house nursery for these plants and successfully
built capacity within MWCJ.

OUTCOME
With dedicated research and execution, this nursery has become a
repository of best practices in horticulture.
Over 5,000 saplings planted from the nursery form a natural ecosystem at
MWCJ. The nursery also supplies plants to the residing companies of
MWCJ, the parent group company Mahindra and Mahindra, as well as to
other companies in the adjoining campuses.

This not only reduces costs but also provides a potential revenue stream and helps
build relationships with existing and new clients.

WASTE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES
Value from Waste, MCL

Think. Eat. Save. Answer.

2

Disposing oil residue (oil sludge)
used to cost Mahindra Composites
Ltd., Pune, INR 19 per kg.

Instead of throwing away the
scrapped plastic sheets that
come as cover for the SMC rolls,

The unit devised novel way of extracting
value out of this waste. It approached a
Maharashtra Pollution Control Board
(MPCB) authorised waste recycler who
readily purchased the sludge at the rate
of INR 5 per kg. This generates a minor
revenue stream for the unit, but most
importantly, it also ensures that the oil
sludge is disposed in a responsible manner.

the unit made a onetime investment on a
sewing machine and
today, makes plastic
bags out of these sheets
and uses them for
storage and disposal of
waste in the plant.

As part of the World Environment
Day celebrations, a quiz
competition - 'Sustainability
Challenge 2013' was organised on
the theme 'Think, Eat, Save'.
Sponsored by Mahindra Sanyo
Special Steel Pvt. Ltd. (MSSSPL) and
conducted in association with
Group Sustainability Cell, the quiz
competition was held to spread
waste minimisation awareness.

Project Vermicompost
Club Mahindra, Thekkady, MHRIL,
undertook a vermicompost project,
wherein they created a compost pit with
a boundary wall made up of used plastic
bottles ﬁlled with sand.

This helped create a robust wall
for the pit while also reusing
the plastic bottles which
otherwise would have added to
environment pollution.

INITIATIVE
Green Soldiers in Action
Big is nothing but a summation of the small. It is the consistent focus on small things that
leads to a large sustainable change. The same is true for environmental protection.

INTERVENTION
The Corporate Sustainability-Green Marshals team at Tech Mahindra works towards spreading awareness among
employees on how day-to-day activities can be done in an environment-friendly way.
Some of these initiatives include:

Green Desktop
Eco-friendly Printer
Policy which limits
number of printed
pages per unit and
promotes use of
eco-friendly paper.
Solar-powered
street lights at
Bangalore campus.

Automated system on each desktop to
switch off the monitor after 10 minutes and
hibernates the machine after 30 minutes.
ZERO electricity wastage - Vendors
operating on campus have been educated
about saving electricity and water. Their
acts are constantly monitored, especially on
holidays and during times of low occupancy.
Penalties are imposed to ensure adherence.

Automated Energy Savers - An
innovative sensor-based system
which switches off lights and ACs in
a room when the last person leaves.
Plantation of around 2,000 trees
in partnership with employees.

Sensitisation and testing of more than 25,000
employees on knowledge about Corporate
Sustainability.
A carpooling website ‘odyssey’ to encourage
carpooling to work.

The Green Marshals across offices continue to promote environmental awareness
and conscious energy consumption. Prominent initiatives are elaborated below:
Green Marshals, Hyderabad

Green Marshals, Chennai

Green Marshals, Mumbai

Launched the 'I Promise to'
campaign that encourages
employees to reduce energy
consumption at work

A rangoli event with a 'Go
Green' theme was held
A skit encouraging
reduced consumption
of electricity, water and
paper was performed
A sapling sale was
conducted

Observed a
‘Green day' celebrating
environmental awareness
and conservation
Hosted a Green Quiz and
a session encouraging
'composting at home'

A Green Christmas was
celebrated with the
employees' children
A drawing competition
under the theme 'GO
Green' was organised
Screened an episode of Satyamev Jayate that
emphasised on saving water and encouraged
consumption of organic vegetables

IMPACT
The initiatives and events thus implemented resulted in increased economic savings, adoption of environmentfriendly practices, increased usage of renewable sources of energy, reforestation, reduced consumption of
electricity, paper, fuel and water, and conscious living and consumption.

Packaging
Packaging is an integral part of most of our businesses. But just because it is indispensable, doesn't mean that it can't be
improved. We have always promoted green packaging and continue to do so. We also make sure that we encourage
reusable packaging materials wherever possible.

GREEN PACKAGING INITIATIVES
MAHINDRA SPARES BUSINESS, KANHE

Filling the Void
The MSB unit at Kanhe transports
a number of products and
individual parts in corrugated
boxes. But if there is a void
between the parts kept inside and
the box then it affects the
structural integrity of the package
and makes it more susceptible to
caving in and harming the product
inside. To counter this, void fillers
in the form of air bags are used to
keep the products tightly housed
inside the boxes.

Hybrid Packaging
While using airbags, the unit
identified that by simply reducing the
perforation between two adjacent
airbags from 2 inches to 1 inch, a lot
of plastic could be saved. But this had
to done without altering the strength
of the bags. Hence, the monolayered
film on the plastic was substituted
with coextruded film. This step
increased the puncture resistance of
the air bags and also helped reduce
the perforation space, resulting in
material and monetary savings.

The packaging used for heavy parts,
hoods, fenders and evaporators is
designed to sustain the transit
shocks, otherwise, it'd lead to dents,
bends or scratches on the product
surface. Traditionally wooden boxes
have been doing this service. This is
not only an environmental risk but
also poses a logistical challenge
because wooden boxes increase the
weight of the overall shipment.
To counter this, we have started
replacing wood packaging with
Hybrid Packaging - a combination of
corrugated material and wood that
reduces the consumption of wood
by up to 60% in each package.

This initiative brought down the number of rolls consumed from 1,685 in the
period of Jan-Mar 2013 to 1,076 rolls in the same period during 2014; a saving
of 3,714 kg of packaging film per annum. When equalled to the reduction in
carbon footprint, this is equivalent to saving 71,144 sq. mt. of forest land
every year. This also helped garner annual monetary savings of INR 30.47 lacs.

One Layer Less for a Greener Packaging
The corrugated boxes used as
primary packaging were
transformed to direct pack
packaging. Their outer paper,
i.e. duplex paper which has a
low Bursting Factor (BF) was
replaced with Kraft paper which
has a higher BF. This helped
eliminate the need of secondary
packaging and recorded annual
monetary savings of INR 8.32 lac.

A material reused and redesigned, is a
material well-used.
Reused the bulk packaging pallets
received from vendors in warehouse,
instead of disposing them away as
scrap.
Heavy parts are now packaged in
boxes with specially designed hybrid
wooden support structures.

This redesign saves 25%
packaging material as compared
to old wooden boxes.

Packaging boxes used for interwarehouse transfers were
designed so that they can be
returned and reused, thus
reducing the use of new
packaging material.

115

Transforming a Village

FES
Wheeling Change

Mahindra Logistics (MLL) has
adopted a village called 'Aavre'
around 92 km. from Mumbai. The
aim is to improve the quality of life
in this village, which is deprived of
all basic infrastructure, hygiene and
health. A survey covering more than
500 houses and around 1000
villagers was conducted by MLL
employees in order to analyse the
socio-economic proﬁle of the
residents.

Women in rural India make up
to six trips a day to fetch fresh
water for her family. These
walks can average ten miles a
day, carrying up to ﬁfteen litres
every trip. Alongside causing
physical stress, this strenuous
ritual also eats up a lot of time.
For younger girls, this means not
being able to go to school.

MLL employees visited the village to
get familiarised with the residents,
interact with them and understand
their difﬁculties and problems.
To initiate bridge-building between
MLL employees and the village
residents, host of activities were
undertaken:
• Drawing competition for the
school kids

After Market Sector

• Stationery kit and snacks
distribution to all children

Bag the Right to Education

• Felicitation of the Gram
Panchayat members and school
teachers

Volunteers from Mahindra First
Choice Services Ltd. (MFCSL)
donated school bags to 50 children.

The Wello Water Wheel is a
joint pilot initiative of the FES
Strategic team and Wello - a
social business organisation
working to remarkably reduce
the drudgery of collecting water
by women. The Wello water
wheel is a 50 litre drum with a
handle that can be rolled on the
ground. The water wheel will
remove a barrier that prevents
children from going to school
and empowers women to
engage in more productive
activities. The watershed
implementation team has so far
facilitated the adoption of 30
water wheels.

• A cultural show comprising
performances by MLL employees
and the village residents

CASE STUDY

Social Impact Assessment Study Conducted for Four Esops Projects

OVERVIEW
To effectively drive positive change, social responsibility needs to be more strategic. Instead of only looking at the funds
and efforts as a parameter to performance, one must focus on social return on investment.

?

What is the
impact of a
social
intervention

?

Is this
intervention
aligned with
the needs of
the community

?

Is the social return
dividend yielded
from your CSR
investment good
enough

?

Are you reaching
the right
stakeholders or
do you need to
go beyond

ASSESSMENT
AS answered these key questions by
undertaking Social Impact Assessment
(SIA) Study to assess the impact of some
of the award-winning ESOPs initiatives
and indentify room for improvement.
The objective was to make community
programmes more effective and expand
the impact they have on the society.

A Social Impact
Assessment helps an
organisation to plan
and implement
programmes, and
bring them to scale.
It also facilitates
accountability,
social responsibility,
stakeholder
communication and
aids in the effective
allocation of
resources.

The SIA was an extensive exercise conducted by Nirmala Niketan, an external
research unit in co-ordination with individual project centres, Mahindra CSR
managers, Esops champions and community members. The data was collected
from 24 different groups of respondents and the initiatives integrated in the
assessment include:

Sanskar Project, Kandivli

Bandhan, Chakan

Facilitating all-round development of
the marginalised youth to enhance
their employment opportunities.

Provide health facilities to improve
maternal and child health.

Prayas,
Nashik

Zaheerabad

Creating awareness on the issue of
HIV / AIDS, providing nutrition to
seropositive children and vocational
training to persons affected by HIV.

Aiding eye care and cataract surgery
for villagers who lack access to eye
care and treatment.

Adding life to years

CASE STUDY

CHALLENGE
Thalassemia is one of the major life threatening diseases
affecting children. A blood disorder in which excessive
destruction of red blood cells leads to acute anemia and its
treatment involves blood transfusions on a regular basis.
At Nashik district, 201 Thalassemia-afﬂicted children were
registered at the civil hospital in FY 2013 for blood donation.
While these children suffered from this dreaded disease, their
parents too remained grieved owing to major economic
burden & psychological stress.

INTERVENTION
Realising the predicament of such afﬂicted children, Esops decided to adopt them all and thus began Project Rakhee.
Beyond adding years to the lives of these children, our Esops volunteers from AD Nashik were also determined on adding
life to their years. While blood support was meticulously managed, various recreational and counselling activities were
organised on a regular basis to enhance their quality of life.
A group of 875 dedicated blood
donors (6 per affected child) were
identiﬁed from Esops volunteers and
in-house blood donation drive was
organised for employee donors as per
the need of each Thalassemia patient.
Alongside providing blood transfusion
facility - several other activities were
spearheaded. For example establishing day care centre, free
treatment & health check-up camps,
procurement of medicines for adopted
children, counselling for children and
parents, encouraging Yoga &
Pranayam, monthly picnics & festival
celebrations for parents and children,
and spreading Thalassemia awareness
among the society.

Below is a snapshot of key interventions of the project:

Educational Support
Education is an investment with an extremely high ROI. Education triggers a virtuous domino of enhanced income levels,
improved health, healthier gender equality, greater opportunities and reduction in poverty.
We at Mahindra, place education as one of our top societal intervention and have adopted a strategic three pronged approach:

Empowering the
girl child through
education

Vocational and
livelihood training
for employment

Scholarship and
nancial support for
marginalised students

PROJECT NANHI KALI
Ripples of Change
The ripples of the project have spread
to 9 states (Maharashtra, AP,
Rajasthan, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh,
Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh
and Haryana) & 30 districts across
the country.

Well plaited hair, neatly worn uniform,
a schoolbag ﬁlled with books and
hopes, and a smile on the face: This is
the dream of every girl child, but sadly
few get such an opportunity.
At Mahindra, we strongly believe that
every girl deserves to go to school that too with full dignity.
Project Nanhi Kali aims to provide not
only academic support to girl children,
but also material and social support
including uniforms, school bags, shoes,
socks etc. which enable her to attend
school with dignity. This
comprehensive intervention ensures
signiﬁcantly low drop-out rates.
Initiated by the K.C. Mahindra
Education Trust in 1996 in partnership
with Naandi Foundation, Project Nanhi
Kali provides primary education to girl
children from backward and
underprivileged classes of society in
India. Currently, Nanhi Kali is working
in collaboration with 21 NGOs at the
grassroots level to ensure that the girls
receive academic and material support.
The criteria for selection of these girls
are the family's income, parents'
educational background, social
background and the child's aptitude.

Project Nanhi Kali has devised a
sponsorship support programme which
allows individuals to contribute
towards the education of a girl child
from a disadvantaged family.

The benets of educating
a female, go beyond just
the female. When a girl is
educated, she has a
signicant impact on her
family, the community
and the economy at large.

Presently the Mahindra
Group independently
sponsors the education
of 36,248 girls in lowliteracy urban, rural and
tribal parts of India.
This coupled with the support from
other corporate and individual donors,
Project Nanhi Kali now supports over
91537 underprivileged girls.
Nanhi Kali has had a signiﬁcant
impact - learning outcomes have
increased by 10% and dropout rates
have been curtailed to less than 10%.

Scholarships and Grants
K C MAHINDRA SCHOLARSHIPS
FOR POST GRADUATE STUDIES ABROAD
Instituted in 1956 with a vision of transforming lives through education, the K C
Mahindra Scholarship for Post Graduate Studies Abroad is an interest-free loan
scholarship, awarded to deserving graduates interested in pursuing their post
graduate studies overseas.
The recipients of the scholarship pursue their post graduation in a wide range of
subjects including computer science, engineering, MBA, law and economics from
renowned universities like the Harvard Business School, Yale, Stanford,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon and London School of
Economics etc.
This year, the trust received 664 applications from students who have obtained
admission to several Ivy League universities in the US and the UK.

From the short listed applications, 43 students were
awarded a scholarship of INR 2 lac each. Further, the
'K C Mahindra Fellows Fund' awarded scholarships
of INR 8 lac each to the top 3 candidates.

MAHINDRA ALL INDIA TALENT SCHOLARSHIP (MAITS)
Established in 1995, the MAITS scholarship is awarded to students from
disadvantaged sections of the society. The scholarship empowers these deserving
students to pursue a job oriented diploma course at a recognised Government
Polytechnic in India.
Approximately 500 scholarships are given every year to students who undergo a
three year course. During this ﬁnancial year, 550 students were conferred the
MAITS scholarship to pursue a diploma course of their choice, leading to
disbursements of INR 117.76 lac.

Since 1956, KCMET has realised
the potential of the Indian
student and decided that it was
time to celebrate the cerebral.
It has been the trust's constant
endeavour to look at people
with humble beginnings and
help them realise their
aspirations, recognising that
money must never come in the
way of achieving the true
potential of an individual.
KCMET rmly believes that
there is no greater denial than
the denial of opportunity. Its
vision is to enable, provide and
catalyse. In that context, over
the last six decades there has
been nothing but happiness,
when some of India's nest
minds irrespective of caste,
creed and colour achieved their
aspirations.

Anand Mahindra
Trustee of K C Mahindra Education Trust,
Chairman, Mahindra Group.

Search for Talent Scholarship for two
consecutive years, also receive the
Honours Scholarship Award
comprising a cash prize of INR 5,000
and a citation from the Trust.

Health Support
As opposed to the age-old wisdom 'health is wealth', in India it could well be said
that 'health is only if you have wealth'. This is because Indian medical services are
unaffordable and inaccessible for large chunks of society.
The rural and tribal areas, the socially backward and the economically
disadvantaged forms a large population of the country that remains completely
cut off from even basic primary healthcare.
At Mahindra, we strive to bring basic healthcare access to the lower strata of society
in the remotest of regions of the country.

LIFELINE EXPRESS

Established in 1991, Lifeline Express is the world's ﬁrst hospital-train that travels
the length and breadth of the country, bringing medical aid and healthcare to
the most inaccessible areas of India. Be it Farrukhabad, UP - a region with one of
the lowest Human Development Index or be it Naksalbari - plagued by the
perceptions of naxalism, Lifeline Express can indeed reach out to people in need.
For the past 20 years, the medical train has travelled to India's poorest and most
backward areas to provide basic surgeries - from cataract procedures to correcting
club feet and polio deformities.
The Mahindra Group, over the years, has supported the Lifeline Express with not
only ﬁnancial assistance, but also by contributing time and expertise through its
employee volunteering programme - Esops.
Steadily and systemically, the Lifeline Express has gathered momentum with an
increase in the number of patients treated on YOY basis, which is evident from

Joining Hands the Esops Way
Employees from Mahindra Finance enthusiastically participated round the clock.
Each team member was assigned speciﬁc responsibility. 25 Financial Service Sector
employees contributed 1,147 man hours, while 67 community volunteers including
doctors and college students spent 3,062 man-hours towards the Lifeline Express.

Since its inception, the Lifeline Express has
helped eradicate avoidable disablement in some
of the remotest areas of the country, serving as
a beacon of hope for thousands of rural folk
who may not have access to medical services.
We are now delighted to bring the train to
Satara which is one of Maharashtra's most
historical cities. The project is a great example
of a successful public - private partnership.

Insuring the Bottom of the Pyramid

CASE STUDY

CHALLENGE
In rural India, future is more often prayed, rather than planned for. Even when savings are done, they are made towards a
speciﬁc expense like marriage, sowing season, or upgrade of farm equipment. In a scenario where the concept of banking
itself has only begun to make headways in the villages, insurance is something less heard of and lesser adopted.

INTERVENTION
Mahindra Insurance Brokers Ltd. (MIBL)
Mahindra Insurance Brokers Ltd. (MIBL) got its Direct Brokers' license in 2004 and started
introducing 360o insurance solutions tailor-made for the diverse needs and risk proﬁles
of a varied Indian demography. It understood the need for cascading insurance coverage
to rural India and has designed a number of innovative products to cater to the last mile.

 Mahindra Loan Suraksha (MLS) is a customised
insurance solution offered to Mahindra Finance
vehicle loan customers, through which, in the
unfortunate event of the loanee's death, the
outstanding loan amount is waived and the
vehicle can be retained by the bereaved family.
Due to shortage of doctors in villages, issuance
of death certiﬁcate becomes a problem.
To overcome this hurdle, MIBL introduced a
process whereby Kotak Mahindra Bank will
accept the proxy of a Panchayat or a Sarpanch
to initiate the process of loan write-off.

 Mahindra Arogya Suraksha
(MAS) is a comprehensive yet
affordable group health
insurance cover that was
launched in September 2012.
It is specially designed to cover
customers in semi-urban and
rural India. Not only does this
product provide coverage
against hospitalisation and
recovery, it also reaches out and
educates rural masses on the
importance of health insurance.

MAHINDRA RACING
In 2011, Mahindra put India on the global map of motorcycle racing, when it
enrolled Mahindra Racing as the ﬁrst Indian team in the FIM MotoGP World

National Motorcycle Racing Championship (CIV) with an entirely new set up.
Mahindra Racing, the ﬁrst and only Indian manufacturer to enter the world of
International Motorcycle Grand Prix Racing scripted history by winning the
prestigious 'Constructors Title' in the Moto3 Class (250cc) at the Italian National
Motorcycle Racing Championship (CIV) in Italy.

Technology AG. Experienced Spanish
rider Efrén Vázquez (26, from Bilbao)
teamed with exciting Portuguese
teenager Miguel Oliveira (18, from
Pragal near Lisbon).
At the opening round in Qatar, the
Mahindra duo had a dream debut
with a double Top 10 result for the

Italian National Motorcycle Racing Championship - CIV
In the 2013 season of Italy's leading national track competition, the team entered
the Moto3 (250cc - 4 stroke) class with two very talented riders, Andrea Locatelli
(16, from Alzano Lombardo) and Michael Rinaldi (17, from Rimini, EmiliaRomagna). Throughout the championship, the riders pulled off a number of
hard-fought podium ﬁnishes in 10 gruelling rounds, with some fantastic double
podiums and top two ﬁnishes.

This historic victory at the
CIV marks a new high for
Mahindra Racing in its journey
towards becoming a global
motorsports brand. Winning
the Constructors Title for the
second year in a row in this
highly competitive series is
also a remarkable
achievement for Indian
motorsport and we are very
proud to have played our
part in making it happen.

lifestyle. This culture is a sharp contrast to the fast pace of modern life, possesses
a certain poise and gentleness, and emphasises tradition and the arts.
The festival brings together four days of art, music, dance, literature, and cuisine.
Artisans and master craftsmen from all over India display their work, while folk
musicians and dancers perform traditional pieces. Attendees can also go on
history tours, attend literature and poetry sessions or sample a mouth-watering
array of gourmet dishes. Held every February, the Mahindra Sanatkada Lucknow
Festival is a celebration of India's vibrant arts, culture and history.

NASSCOM

Solar Reectance Index

A not-for-proﬁt organisation set up in 1988 to facilitate
business and trade in software and services and to
encourage advancement of research in software
technology.

Solar Reﬂectance is the fraction of the incident solar
energy which is reﬂected by the surface in question.
The best standard technique for its determination uses
spectrophotometric measurements, with an integrating
sphere to determine the reﬂectance at each different
wavelength. The average reﬂectance is then determined
by an averaging process, using a standard solar
spectrum. This method is documented by ASTM
(American Society for Testing and Materials).

Scope I
Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions occur from sources that
are owned or controlled by a company, such as
combustion facilities (e.g.: boilers, furnaces, burners,
turbines, heaters, incinerators, engines, ﬂares etc),
combustion of fuels in transportation (e.g.: cars, buses,
planes, ships, barges, trains etc) and physical or chemical
processes (e.g.: in cement manufacturing, catalytic
cracking in petrochemical processing, aluminium
smelting etc).
Scope II
Scope 2 GHG emissions are from the generation by
another party of electricity that is purchased and
consumed by the company. This is described as "purchased
electricity" for the purposes of the GHG Protocol.
Scope III
Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions, including those
associated with employee travel, supply chain, leased
assets, outsourced activities, use of products and waste
disposal.
