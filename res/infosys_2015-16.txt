What does sustainability mean to us?

Sustainability disclosures

As a global leader in consulting, technology, and outsourcing solutions,
Infosys works with clients in over 50 countries. Our experience gives our
clients a distinct advantage, helping them manage their businesses and power
their transformation into smarter, sustainable organizations.

This is our ninth year of reporting on sustainability disclosures. This report
provides detailed information on our responsible business practices across
the economic, social and environmental parameters ‘in accordance’ –
comprehensive with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 guidelines. The
GRI G4 content index is available in the GRI reporting framework G4 – Content
Index section of this report. The report also conforms to the United Nations
Global Compact (UNGC) principles and forms the basis of our communication
on progress (CoP) with the UNGC each year. We have been reporting our
sustainability disclosures in accordance with the GRI G4 (comprehensive)
guidelines since 2014. Our sustainability disclosures showcase the maturity
of our sustainability management system and reporting practices, and address
the growing interest and heightened expectations of our global stakeholders.
Our reporting framework fits the broader process of setting organizational
strategy, deciding management approaches, implementing action plans, and
assessing output and outcomes.

Technology is reshaping our world in a fundamental way. The world of our
future looks vastly different from what we see today – an increasingly digital
world, a deeply connected world, a collaborative world. Given this digital
transformation of our world, the traditional services industry of the past, in
which we compete to do the same work cheaper but with world-class quality,
must also transform. A services company must be more, and we, Infoscions,
as individuals and as a company, must be more. We must become a company
that delivers value and innovation to build a sustainable future for ourselves
and for our clients.
While we pursue this with great passion, we also realize that enterprises have
to be conscious and responsible about their consumption of natural resources.
Essential resources such as water and energy are important to a services
industry like ours. We encounter the impact of climate change in our day-today life more frequently in recent times. The floods in the city of Chennai in
the southern part of India is a grim reminder of the interplay between climate
change and business. Environmental stewardship is therefore an integral part
of our sustainability agenda.
Contributing to the world around us by reaching out to the communities
in the regions where we operate has always been integral to our corporate
social responsibility. From uplifting the poorest sections of society through
the Infosys Foundation, promoting science and math education in the U.S.
through the Infosys Foundation USA, encouraging science and research
through the Infosys Science Foundation, increasing the employability of
engineering students through Campus Connect, and to simply empowering
our employees become responsible citizens through volunteering, we will
continue to strive towards inclusive growth and community development.

Reporting cycle
Our sustainability strategy forms the basis of running our business responsibly
and successfully. We work with our internal and external stakeholders to define
our sustainability strategy and goals. Our sustainability agenda focuses on
social, environment and economic dimensions and is based on the foundation
of our values, known in short as C-LIFE : Client value, Leadership by example,
Integrity and transparency, Fairness, and Excellence.
Our sustainability goals are part of our corporate scorecard. These goals
are further cascaded to leaders of business units and enabler functions with
the requisite authority to execute them. The Management’s discussion and
analysis section in our Annual Report highlights strategic priorities to achieve
our economic, social and environmental goals across short, medium and longterm horizons.
We review the progress on material aspects concerning our stakeholders on
a regular basis and communicate the progress through appropriate channels.
Periodic discussions and reviews with the Board and its committees, the senior
management and other stakeholders across the organization help us work
consistently towards fulfilling the expectations of our direct and indirect
stakeholders. This apart, our enterprise-wide risk management framework
monitors social and environmental risks as part of the societal risks on a
quarterly basis.
The Corporate Sustainability team works in collaboration with internal and
external stakeholders under the leadership of Ramadas Kamath U., our
Executive Vice President and Head of Infrastructure and Sustainability, to
institutionalize sustainability policies, processes, practices, and reporting.

We report the goals, progress and management of these material aspects
/ topics in our corporate reports – the Annual Report and the Sustainability
Report – available on www.infosys.com.

Reporting constraints and limitations
The reporting boundary for our disclosures covers the Infosys Group (all
our global operations), including subsidiaries, on the economic, social and
environmental parameters (unless otherwise stated).
The following are the limitations relating to certain environmental, social and
governance parameters in the current reporting cycle :

Boundary-related
Being an Information Technology (IT) and consulting company, our solutions
and services rely more on intellectual assets than on physical assets. Our
supply chain implications are primarily related to our large supplier base for
the procurement of goods and services to support our operations. We are
currently engaging with the suppliers working within our boundary. Social
and environmental impacts of suppliers working within our boundary are fully
reported. At present, our ability to influence our product suppliers (operating
outside our boundary) on the social and environmental aspects is limited as
our annual spend is lower than 1% of our suppliers’ annual revenue.

Confidentiality
Details of individual compensation are subject to confidentiality constraints.
However, the Board compensation and the compensation of senior executives
across the globe are provided in our Annual Report 2015-16.

The Sustainability Report is reviewed and verified by an internal independent
group, Corporate Certifications and Assessments (CCAT), in accordance with
the requirements of the GRI G4 guidelines. The report is also assured by
an independent external auditor, DNV GL Business Assurance India Private
Limited, and their assurance statement is available in the Independent
Assurance Statement section of this report.

U. B. Pravin Rao
Chief Operating Officer and Whole-time Director

Creating a smart, sustainable world
The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for a
concerted effort from all countries and stakeholders to implement bold and
transformative steps needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient
path. As part of this plan, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169
targets have been announced, building on the Millennium Development Goals
in an integrated and indivisible manner and balancing the three dimensions
of sustainable development : the economic, social and environmental. The
goals and targets are expected to stimulate action over the next 15 years in
areas of critical importance for the planet and humanity. In September 2015,
heads of state and governments across the globe adopted these goals and
committed to periodically review progress against them.

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

As a global corporation that is passionate about sustainable development,
we take great pride that our own goals and commitments are in alignment
with the SDGs. Our strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization.
Our Sustainability Policy drafted in 2008 articulated our commitment to
make our business sustainable, our clients’ businesses sustainable, and our
ecosystem and lifestyles sustainable. Staying relevant to the agenda of our
clients’ businesses has sharpened our focus on three strategic areas, viz., to
renew ourselves and help our clients renew their businesses; drive innovation
and new opportunities for ourselves and our clients; and anchor our business
in a culture of learning and collaboration. The progress we have made in
the execution of our strategy is evident not just in our results but also in the

Creating a smart, sustainable world | 6

appreciation we have received from our clients and partners as well as industry
bodies, media and analysts in recent times.
To achieve our vision to build sustainable ecosystems, we identified energy,
emissions, water and waste as material aspects to focus on as part of our
environmental sustainability efforts. Building employee engagement through
responsible citizenship initiatives has allowed us to make progress in the
journey to inspire sustainable lifestyles across the Infosys community.
We became the first IT company in the world to make a commitment in the
UN to become carbon neutral by fiscal 2018, reduce per capita electricity
consumption by 50% (against the baseline year 2008), and use 100%
renewable power by 2018.
Our progress on these goals is heartening. The global challenges posed by the
larger ecosystems, such as regulation and government policy, priorities and
programs, require a more concerted effort from industry bodies, corporations
and citizens alike to tackle effectively. This year, we made investments in carbon
offset projects, which have environmental and social impacts. We became the
first Indian company to join RE100 – a global platform for major companies
committed to 100% renewable power. Our campus at Hyderabad has a solar
plant that can help us meet 100% of our electricity needs and we continue to
innovate on improving energy performance in buildings by focusing on highly
efficient building designs, smart building automation and deep green retrofits.
Our water conservation strategy encompasses action to reduce recycle and
reuse. Today, we have 149 recharge wells and 25 lakes across our campuses.
This has also positively impacted the preservation of native flora and fauna
species. We have been able to reduce our per capita water consumption by
41% compared to 2008 levels.
We are also working relentlessly to achieve zero waste to landfill and 100%
food waste treatment within our campuses.

As a responsible corporation, we continue to work with the larger community
that we are part of and inspire our employees to become responsible citizens.
The Infosys Foundation continues to expand its reach and make a difference
by empowering people and communities. It lends support to projects in
various areas including the eradication of hunger and malnutrition, promoting
healthcare, education, art and culture, destitute care and rehabilitation,
environmental sustainability, disaster relief and rural development.
The Infosys Foundation USA supports several leading Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs and community building
initiatives. It also works on expanding access to Computer Science education
and ‘Maker’ initiatives across the U.S.
The Infosys Science Foundation, set up in 2005 to encourage the pursuit and
practice of the sciences, has awarded the Infosys Prize to 44 people since
its inception.
Twelve years after it was set up, Campus Connect, our flagship industryacademia program, is still touching the lives of engineering students across
India and raising their employability.
Infosys believes it has a role to play in building and nurturing a better world
– a world of opportunity for everyone. We forge strategic partnerships with
industry bodies and consortiums at the local, national and international levels.
Our advocacy efforts are championed across the world by our senior leaders
across economic, social and environmental dimensions.
Moving into the new fiscal, we will continue to power our sustainability
initiatives with energy and commitment. We take our duty of being a
responsible global corporation seriously and we want sustainability and
responsible citizenship to be a way of life for all Infoscions as they discover
their passion to ‘Be More’.

Being an organization that is dependent on the competence of its people
to deliver value to clients, our employees are our most valued assets. Our
employee-focused interventions enabled us to reduce the attrition rate from
18.9% in fiscal 2015 to 13.6% this year.

Material aspects /
topics
Social responsibility

What is the scope?

Why is it material for us?

•	 Direct and indirect investments to
society

Infosys has been an early adopter of corporate
social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The
Company works primarily through the Infosys
Foundation and the Infosys Foundation USA,
towards supporting projects in the areas
of eradication of hunger and malnutrition,
promoting education, art and culture, healthcare,
destitute care and rehabilitation, environmental
sustainability, disaster relief and rural
development.
The environmental footprint of our organization is
proportional to its energy consumption, which also
has a direct bearing on our operational costs, and
overall exposure to fluctuations in energy supply and
prices.

•	 Impacts of community
investments

Environmental
stewardship

•	 Energy
•	 Emissions
•	 Water
•	 Waste and effluents

As a responsible organization, we aim to manage our
footprint on emissions, including greenhouse gases.
We have also made a voluntary commitment to
become carbon neutral by fiscal 2018.

How do we measure and
monitor (KPI)?
•	 Community investments
•	 Number of community programs /
initiatives rolled out

•	 Total water consumption
•	 Total energy consumption
•	 GHG emissions
•	 Waste generated by weight /
volume

India and the APAC are among the water-stressed
zones of the world. Since most of our operations are
based in these regions, it is critical for us to manage
this resource efficiently. Hence, this aspect is material
to our operations. We aim to make our campuses
water-sustainable.
We also have a focused approach to manage waste
generated due to our operations. We play a vital
role in influencing our supply chain for efficient
management of waste, and insist on the reuse of
packaging material used in the supply of goods to us.

Our business imperatives and strategy
Our ‘Renew and New’ strategy that we adopted last year for consistent and
profitable growth of the Company is making progress, and we are executing
on our strategy.
In fiscal 2016, our revenues grew by 9.1% to US $9,501 million and in constant
currency terms, revenues grew by 13.3%. For the fiscal year 2016, our
operating profit margin was 25.0% and net profit margin was 21.6%. During
the year, earnings per share grew by 9.4% in rupee terms and 1.9% in dollar
terms. Our operating cash flow was healthy during the year and we ended
the year with liquid assets of US $5,202 million.
Our large deal wins have improved significantly during the year, demonstrating
that the renewal of our existing core services, together with all of the new
things that we can bring, is helping us to differentiate on value, not cost. The
total contract value of large deals won during the year increased by 45% to
US $2.8 billion this year.
Similarly, owing to our focused client engagement and value creation, the
revenue growth from top clients improved during the year. Revenue from our
top 10 clients grew by 12.3% in constant currency and our top 25 clients grew
by 9.3% in constant currency during the year.
Our efforts to increase per capita revenue improvement through productivity
improvement and automation are in early stages. We will continue to focus
on increasing automation in projects. We have several additional levers to
further enhance operational efficiency, such as utilization, onsite effort mix,
onsite employee cost and subcontractor expenses, which we plan to optimize.
Turning to what and how we deliver to our clients – we took big steps in fiscal
2016 by bringing a combination of automation and innovation, powered by
education and design thinking, to clients, and are now building on this work.

Our strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains
relevant to the agenda of our clients, while generating profitable growth for
our investors. In order to do this, we will continue to apply the priorities of
‘renew and new’ to our own business and cascade it to everything we do.
These translate to the following strategic focus areas :
Build lasting relationships with our clients by delivering differentiated market
offerings : Our strategy is to engage with clients on their large transformative
programs, both in traditional IT areas as well as for their new digital business

initiatives. We plan to expand existing client relationships by providing them
a broad set of end-to-end service offerings and increase the size, nature and
number of projects we do with them. Our specific industry, domain, process,

Deliver solutions and services leveraging highly cost-effective models : Our
strategy is to leverage software-based automation and our Global Delivery
Model to deliver solutions and services to our clients in the most cost-effective
manner, while at the same time optimizing our cost structure to remain
competitive. We are embracing artificial intelligence-based automation
techniques and software automation platforms to dramatically boost
productivity of our projects. We are leveraging software process engineering
and collaboration technologies to improve process productivity. Our Global
Delivery Model provides scale, quality, expertise and cost and time-to-market
advantages to our client projects. The model enables us to perform work
at the location where the best talent is available and where it makes the
best economic sense with the least amount of acceptable risk. Over the last
30 years, we have developed our distributed execution capabilities to deliver

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

high quality and scalable services. This scalable infrastructure complements
our ability to deliver project components that are executed round the clock
and across time zones enabling us to reduce project delivery times.
Enhance our operational processes for agility and cost : We periodically assess
the effectiveness of our organization structure and processes to optimize it for
alignment with our strategic objectives and agility. We continually evaluate
critical cross-functional processes and benchmark them with best-in-class
practices to optimize costs and enable swift and effective response to our
clients. We constantly monitor and optimize various operational parameters
such as the cost and utilization of resources, distribution of employees around
the world, the cost of operating our campuses and whether we are optimally
realizing the efficiencies of scale.
Attract and retain a global, diverse, motivated and high-performing employee
base : Our employees are our biggest asset. To meet the evolving needs
of our clients, our priority is to attract and engage the best talent in the
right locations with the right skills. We offer our employees challenging work
assignments, benchmarked compensation and a collaborative, productive
work environment. Our performance management system is based on
objectivity and rewards performance. We invest substantially in employee
engagement to motivate employees and encourage social communication
and collaboration. Teaching and learning is central to the Infosys culture.
Our investments in our Global Education Center and in creating various
learning opportunities for our employees help our employees stay abreast
of new developments in software technologies, spur innovation and help
them build a lifelong career at Infosys. We are guided by our value system
which motivates our attitudes and actions. Our core values are Client value,
Leadership by example, Integrity and transparency, Fairness and Excellence
(C-LIFE).
Pursue strategic alliances and acquisitions : We leverage alliances that
complement our core competencies. We partner with leading technology
software and hardware providers in creating, deploying, integrating and
operating business solutions for our clients. We have also expanded the scope
of our collaborations to encompass universities and research organizations.
We will deploy our capital in making selective business acquisitions that

augment our expertise, complement our presence in certain market segments
and accelerate the execution of our strategies. We have allocated $500 million
towards an innovation fund to tap into innovation networks of early stage
companies and universities to gain access to new thinking and business
models. For more details, refer to Management’s discussion and analysis
section in our Annual Report available on www.infosys.com.

decisions. Our annual Client Value Survey (CVS) and Engagement-level
feedback help us take corrective actions, gain insights and understand
our clients better. The CVS framework includes a structured questionnaire
with a satisfaction rating on a seven‑point scale, encompassing close to 30
parameters, with language versions in English French, German, Japanese
and Spanish.

Client focus

Feedback is collected through a web survey hosted by an independent
organization ensuring the confidentiality of the information shared. The survey
model focuses on :

Infosys enables clients in more than 50 countries to stay ahead of emerging
business trends and outperform their competition. Our experience gives our
clients a distinct advantage. We deliver business value in global scalability,
process efficiency and cost optimization for our clients. We constantly engage
with our clients to receive feedback and suggestions to improve our services.

•	 Expectation and fulfillment – the top three expectations of CXOs and
senior-level respondents and their perception on fulfillment
•	 Client disposition – Gauging the overall experience of working with us
•	 Business and technology priorities along with expectations

Client engagement

•	 Service line feedback

In addition to communication that happens with all client for ongoing projects
and prospects, We interact with our clients on a regular basis across multiple
platforms. We host premier CXO‑level events annually in Europe and the
Americas, which are specifically designed for our BPO clients and for the
banking clients of Finacle.

•	 Comparison with best-of-breed firms – client‑selected benchmarks

The forums that have been set up to engage and strengthen our partnerships
with clients are as follows :
•	 Client satisfaction surveys
•	 Engagement-level feedback
•	 Client visits and meetings
•	 Quarterly business reviews
•	 Sustainability portal on our website, www.infosys.com
•	 Conclaves and workshops

•	 Clustering clients into homogeneous groups to ensure a differential
approach
The feedback that we receive through the survey informs various change
initiatives in the organization. The data gathered is analyzed statistically to
classify clients into core, moderate and breakaway groups. The account teams
are then facilitated to review their relationships with individual clients and to
design interventions that create a positive and visible impact on our clients.
Various members across levels engage with clients to seek their feedback and
inputs on service delivery, product expectations and technology requirements.
Overall, the client experience has remained at similar levels as last year.
There has been a notable improvement in experience among the CXOs when
compared to the previous year.

•	 Analyst meets

Over the past three years we have seen an improvement in the client experience
scores across Loyalty, Advocacy, Satisfaction and Business Value by 5%.

We have a robust system to receive feedback from clients and understand
their expectations. We also gather ‘feedforward’ that allows us to understand
the client’s expectations and needs and helps us make the right investment

A number of strategic initiatives including the Zero Distance (ZD), Design
Thinking (dT) and innovation investments have been instituted based on our

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

Our business imperatives and strategy | 15

client feedback. Refer to the Technology and innovation section later in the
report for more details on ZD and dT.
Engagement level feedback (ELF) is a periodic survey, and is done multiple
times during the course of a project. It covers 14 different parameters and
includes areas such as, service delivery management, the quality of products
or services delivered, and behavioral competencies of team members involved
in the engagement. Our delivery and quality teams collaborate to study and
evaluate a set of parameters during an engagement with an aim to improve
the quality of deliverables and obtain client satisfaction. ELF is also treated as
the lead indicator in our annual CVS. Based on the account-level ELF, the client
partner and the delivery anchor drive improvement programs for the account.
For more details, refer to Adding client value section in our Annual Report
available on www.infosys.com.

Partnerships and alliances
Forging alliances and partnerships is a strategic imperative for us. We have
a well-defined alliance strategy at the organizational level that enables
business units to chart out an alliance plan that guides global partnerships
for co-creating solutions. A strong governance board regulates the global
partnership programs. We have documented processes to guide us through
the lifecycle of selecting, engaging, managing, assessing and terminating
alliances. Risks relating to alliances are tracked at the business unit level and
get aggregated to the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.
For more details, refer to the Risk Management Report in our Annual Report
available on www.infosys.com.

Business continuity management
Phoenix, our business continuity management program, is headed by
U.  B.  Pravin Rao, our Chief Operating Officer. The Phoenix framework
enables us to identify business impacts of any disruption in our services and
allows us to frame plans to manage related risks. Redundancy has been built
into all essential infrastructure including office space, network connectivity,
power, computing resources and personnel. All development centers have

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

designated storage and recovery sites. Business continuity plans are created
and regularly exercised at the function, location and account levels. Regular
exercises ensure the collaboration of various internal departments and active
participation of employees. The Infosys Business Continuity Management
System is assessed and certified for ISO 22301 standard.

Intellectual property
We recognize the growing importance of Intellectual Property (IP) in our
day‑to‑day business. Understanding the various components of our intellectual
property and using it effectively is core to our business strategy. Infosys has
created intellectual property over the years. We have well-defined policies
and practices to protect our existing intellectual property assets and to derive
maximum value from them to enhance business profitability. It is with this view
that we have adopted a two-pronged approach :
•	 Innovation
•	 Value enhancement
With an innovation-centric approach, the focus is towards generating
proprietary intellectual property and enhancing the services efficiency and
value addition in our offerings. Intellectual property links innovation and
commercialization. We systematically focus on taking steps necessary to
identify, protect and manage the intellectual property assets to derive this
benefit for our business. To enrich and strengthen our research efforts, we
incentivize and recognize inventors through rewards at various levels.
Value enhancement focuses on generating maximum value for our
shareholders and customers. Many of our intellectual property assets have
been translated into offerings for our clients and aid our business practices.
We constantly evaluate the return on our current assets as well as the return
on investment on future intellectual property to maintain a strong balance
between innovation and resulting value. Further, risk mitigation processes
entail implementing initiatives and programs to ensure compliance to licenses
/ agreements and respecting third-party intellectual property.
We believe this two-pronged approach will, in the long term, enable us to
be leaders in the industry for innovation and also in our obligation to show
value to all stakeholders.
Our business imperatives and strategy | 16

Privacy and data protection
We have stringent processes and practices to ensure that data privacy is
maintained. The global nature of our operations may require that personal
data, originating from a region with stringent data privacy laws, may be
processed in another part of the world with an emerging privacy regulatory
regime. It is, therefore, imperative that, regardless of the location of data
processing, adequate measures around personal data processing are
deployed to not only strengthen our compliance to applicable data protection
laws, but also to create stakeholder trust and confidence.

SV, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001. We have received an independent auditor’s
assurance report on compliance to ISAE 3402 / SSAE16 and a certification of
compliance on PCIDSS V 3.0 for Infosys BPO Limited. We also get assessed
at CMMi Level 5. According to the Process Maturity Profile published by the
CMMi Institute of Carnegie Mellon University in December 2015, only 7% of
12,691 organizations globally are operating at Level 5, which is the highest
level of process maturity. Our Quality department handles large change
management initiatives to drive quality and productivity improvements across
the Company, using various techniques such as Six Sigma, Lean methodology,
and engineering levers like Reuse, Automation and Tools.

A dedicated data privacy group and a cross‑functional Information Security
Council, headed by the COO, U. B. Pravin Rao, ensure data privacy compliance
in our client engagements and the highest level of sponsorship for it. As we
cater to client organizations from diverse industries, such as banking, retail,
telecom and healthcare, the scope of privacy and data protection for personal
data of individual consumers is often limited to contractual requirements
agreed upon with our clients, and subsequently deployed during project
execution.

Technology and innovation

Our clients translate applicable data protection laws into contractual
requirements, wherever appropriate and Infosys implements necessary and
sufficient measures to comply with these requirements. In fiscal 2016, three
incidents relating to breach of customer data privacy were reported. All
incidents have been addressed and closed.

At Infosys, our innovation agenda is guided by the workings of Design
Thinking. It encourages the discovery of unknown and unarticulated problems
– the what and the how – followed by the search for the most technically
feasible and economically viable solution. We call it the Zero Distance
approach. It has three tenets, to close the gap or Zero the Distance between
us and code, clients, and the end-user. We must progressively reduce the
gap to client expectations and needs till we are at Zero Distance to the client.

Quality
We continue our journey of delivering value to our clients through significant
investments in quality programs. While sustaining existing external
benchmarks and certifications, we have added new certifications and further
enhanced our programs and initiatives to renew our commitment to the
culture of quality, client value, innovation and productivity improvement. We
continue to adhere to international quality standard certifications such as ISO
9001, ISO 22301, ISO 20000, ISO 27001, AS EN 9100, ISO 13485, TL 9000

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

Being a technology company, we believe that innovation and its incorporation
into organizational culture are of utmost importance. The ‘Renew, new’
journey of Infosys is fuelled by bringing more innovation to everything that
we do. While dedicated research and innovation hubs are essential, catalyzing
grassroots innovation is the key to deliver more value to our clients and other
stakeholders.

The first step we take is to nail those real problems, the ones that the client
truly desires to see resolved, and yet is often unable to articulate entirely.
This is then substantiated with the application of a simple five-step innovation
framework. It directs the process of everyday innovation purposefully so
that Infoscions can innovate in their individual capacities and through their
individual day-jobs.

Our business imperatives and strategy | 17

The recommendations made by the framework are :
•	 Think, look, learn and improve : Look around and seek out new ideas
from other people, functions and businesses and see how that might be
extrapolated to work in a changed context.
•	 Make at least two ‘what’ improvements to regular tasks : Ask what more,
what other things can be done, within a project, to bring more value to
the client.
•	 Make at least one ‘how’ improvement : What might be the better, more
efficient way to do things – this is a question that is relevant to everything
we do – doing things better than before.

•	 Answer the question of ‘why’ of the innovation and share learnings with the
rest of the organization : Others can then begin their own Zero Distance
journey by looking at the innovation example to chart their own innovation
course.
We collectively notched up more than 7,000 ideas and innovations during the
year for our clients using the Zero Distance innovation framework.
For more details on our success stories, refer to our Annual Report available
on www.infosys.com.

•	 Articulate the value of these innovations in business terms : Help users see
the value of each improvement through effective business value articulation.

Corporate governance and compliance
Corporate governance is about maximizing shareholder value legally, ethically
and sustainably. At Infosys, the goal of corporate governance is to ensure
fairness for every stakeholder. We believe sound corporate governance is
critical to enhancing and retaining investor trust. We always seek to ensure
that our performance is driven by integrity. Our Board exercises its fiduciary
responsibilities in the widest sense of the term. Our disclosures seek to attain
the best practices in international corporate governance. We also endeavor
to enhance long-term shareholder value and respect minority rights in all our
business decisions.

a four-stage integrated framework called VIVA was conceptualized in fiscal
2013. We have a well-defined mechanism to receive and address social and
environmental grievances from our suppliers. The VIVA framework includes :

Our corporate governance practices apply across the Infosys Group and
extend to our suppliers and partners too. Our code of conduct and ethics
complies with the legal requirements of applicable laws and regulations,
including anti‑bribery and anti‑corruption, the ethical handling of conflicts of
interest, and the fair, accurate and timely disclosure of reports and documents
that are filed with the required regulatory bodies. Every employee attends
a session on Company values during his / her induction, and signs up a
declaration to follow our code of conduct and ethics. Additional policies,
such as the Whistleblower Policy and Gift Policy, and the presence of a strong
grievance redressal body help us maintain an uncompromising stand on value
transgressions. For more details, refer to the Corporate Governance Report
in our Annual Report available on www.infosys.com.

Assessing : Assessing supplier performance along environmental, social and
governance parameters.

No instances of regulatory non-compliance were reported in fiscal 2016.

Responsible supply chain
Being an Information Technology and consulting company, our solutions
and services rely more on intellectual assets. We have a large supplier base
for the procurement of goods and services to support our operations. We
recognize that suppliers are valuable stakeholders in our business ecosystem.
This has encouraged us to progressively strengthen our responsible supply
chain practices every year.
In order to strengthen responsible business practices in our supply chain,
Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

Visioning : Drafting policies and guidelines and operating code for the
supply chain
Inculcating : Focusing on process improvements
Valuing : Creating awareness and providing training and competency building

A Responsible Supply Chain Policy that categorizes our suppliers into three
broad categories – people, services and products – was launched in 2013.
A Supplier Code of Conduct was administered to all key suppliers in 2014.
To comply with local legislations applicable in the regions of our operations,
we sign the Master Service Agreements (MSA) with all our vendors. The
MSA mandates the vendor to abide by the regulatory and governmental
laws applicable. We also expect our suppliers to support and respect the
protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and to ensure that they
are not complicit in human rights abuses. Our contracts have appropriate
clauses and checks to prevent the employment of child labor or forced labor
in any form. We also provide forums where suppliers can voice their concerns
and issues.
To facilitate risk assessment, we have further classified the suppliers under 14
segments. Supplier risk assessment across the 14 sub-categories of suppliers
have been integrated with the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework
at the organizational level.
For further details about our Enterprise Risk Management framework,
refer to the Risk Management Report in our Annual Report available on
www.infosys.com.

Corporate governance and compliance | 19

We have deployed a comprehensive engagement model called 3I (Involve,
Influence and Inform) is our framework to engage with our suppliers. We
continue to engage with all supplier segments working within our boundary
covering People and Services categories (9 out of 14 segments) by conducting
training, assessments and audits on Health and Safety, Compliance and AntiCorruption, Human Rights, Anti-Harassment.
We have had 1,516 new suppliers empaneled during fiscal 2016, all of whom
were empaneled using our environment social governance (ESG) criteria. We
engage with local suppliers for our ‘People’ and ‘Services’ categories. Our
proportion of spending on local suppliers at significant locations of operations
was about 79% for fiscal 2016.
Food inspections are carried out by catering committees (that have
representation from the Facilities department and employees in all campuses)
on food and beverage suppliers. Vehicle inspections are carried out on
transportation suppliers to assess the quality of the vehicles provided for
employee commute.
In line with our philosophy of equal opportunity and inclusivity, we track the
business we do in India, under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
Development (MSMED) Act, and in the U.S. under the Minority Business
Enterprise (MBE) and Women Business Enterprise (WBE) group. We intend
to strengthen our supplier diversity in the coming years.
The environmental footprint of people and service suppliers working within
our boundary are included as part of our environmental footprint. At present,
our ability to influence our product suppliers (operating outside our boundary)
on the social and environmental aspects is limited as our annual spend is lower
than 1% of our suppliers’ annual revenue.
In 2015-16, we attempted to gauge the environmental impact of our suppliers
outside the boundary (product suppliers) by trying to measure the embedded
carbon per product purchased to include them under the scope 3 emissions
so that they could be considered in our carbon offsets.

However, the computation and disclosure of such metrics is not readily
available for all categories of products. Therefore, we have decided that while
we continue to engage with the suppliers to try and influence their operations
to minimize water, energy, waste and emissions, it would be too early to take
targets and goals in this area.

Construction site improvements
This year, we continued to focus on health, safety and compliance at our
construction sites. Through internal audits carried out by our corporate
audits and assessment group and as a result of systemic governance on
deployment, review and monitoring the safety incidents at constructions sites
have significantly reduced by close to 40% as against our figures in fiscal 2015.
In addition to safety, the audit and review process includes human rights
aspects, compliance to applicable laws, and Infosys’ requirements.
The following diagram shows the comparative trend of incidents at our
construction sites over the last four fiscals (2012-13 to 2015-16).

Employee well-being
Human resources management at Infosys goes beyond the set boundaries
of compensation, performance reviews, and development. We look at the
employees’ well-being holistically, to ensure timely interventions that help
build a career that is long-lasting and fruitful. A large part of our focus was
on listening to employee feedback to make the right changes, thereby
building a ground-up movement for most of them. Through all these focused
interventions, our attrition levels have come down from 18.9% in the previous
year to 13.6% this year.
Some of the highlights of the important initiatives in fiscal 2016 are as follows :
Zero Distance (ZD) : A unique interactive program to connect employees with
the senior leaders was a huge success. ZD stands as a great example of
employee engagement built through ground-up involvement in organizational
growth and strategy. The interactions between the CEO, delivery leadership
and employees on Zero Distance increased in frequency, with approximately
one global interaction per month.
Global Hackathon : To foster a culture of innovation, we launched the second
season of the Infosys Global Hackathon. The objective of the Hackathon is to
inculcate the culture of rapid problem-solving using technology.
Zero Bench : We introduced Zero Bench in July 2015, an initiative to eradicate
the bench (bench is a term used in the IT industry for an employee who is not
allocated to a project). Using a collaborative platform called ‘Accelerate’, we
were able to bring work creators and work performers to collaborate to bring
value to the organization. In just nine months, by the end of the fiscal 2016,
more than 12,000 jobs had been created on the Zero Bench marketplace,
and more than 67% of employees on the bench had completed at least one
assignment using the platform.
iCount : Another big move, considered revolutionary given the size of the
organization, was the introduction of iCount, the renewed performance
management system. We moved away from the bell curve, to focus on
individual employee contribution and continuous feedback.

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

LITMUS : As always, we gathered feedback from employees across all our
communication channels and platforms, including the annual employee
engagement survey (LITMUS 2016).
Expert Track : We worked on an exercise named Expert Track to identify
domain and technology experts within the organization and among fresh
hires, to spread ideas of innovation and improve collaboration.
Rewards and recognition : Rewards and recognition in terms of the annual
Awards for Excellence, quarterly promotions, and unit awards continued.
Compass : We launched Compass, a digital platform to mobilize internal
opportunities on careers, learning and networks. It is designed to be a selfservice portal, which empowers employees to design their own journey
within the organization by enabling them with the right information, support
structure and access.
Engagement channels : At Infosys, we have multiple channels to identify
employee engagement requirements – ranging from platforms that encourage
two-way communication to surveys and face-to-face discussions. Yammer,
Infosys’ enterprise networking platform, provides social and professional
networking among employees across different time zones. As it is available
on smartphones, it truly connects people across the globe in real time and
assists in building a culture of collaboration. Employees share information,
thoughts, and opinions with other like-minded people, and also post queries
to which they get an almost-immediate response. It also serves as a useful
tool in communicating organizational information, and increasing leadership
connect through online chats.
Diversity and Inclusion : As an equal-opportunity employer, we make
employment decisions based on merit and business needs. The Company’s
policy prohibits harassment of any kind, including harassment based on
pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, race, religion, creed,
color, gender, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability,

Employee well-being | 21

medical condition, marital status, age, or on any other basis protected by
laws of the countries in which we operate. This year, we also strengthened our
Diversity and Inclusion focus by identifying three diversity indicators – Gender,
Nationality and Disability. We are working aggressively towards increasing
the percentage of women to 25% in leadership, to increase the percentage
of non-Indian nationals to 15% globally and to make our workplaces more
inclusive for persons with disability.
Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative (ASHI) : To foster a positive workplace, free
from harassment of any nature, we have institutionalized the ASHI framework,
through which we redress complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace.
Our global policy assures discretion and guarantees non-retaliation to all
the complainants.
Recruitment : We have set up a scalable recruitment and human resources
management process. Over the last year, on a standalone basis, we received
1,115,745 applications from prospective employees. The Infosys Group
added 17,857 (net) and 52,545 (gross) employees this year, taking the total
strength to 194,044 from 176,187 at the end of the previous year.
Health Assessment and Lifestyle Enrichment program (HALE) : Our HALE
program addresses the rising concerns regarding employee health and the
impact of stress on the employees and their families. HALE has four key focus
areas : Health, Safety, Leisure and Emotional well-being. Engagement on each
track happens through the year, through workshops, emails, health checks,
online chats, fun quizzes, etc. A few HALE offerings are also available to the
employees’ families.
Samaritans Network : With the rising stress in general and its impact on
productivity, we have another unique program at Infosys known as the
Samaritans Network, a barefoot counselor support among fellow Infoscions
to provide necessary emotional support to employees. We also have world-

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

class sports facilities in each of our campuses across India to encourage
work-life balance and promote a healthy lifestyle. In addition, we also have
various facilities such as multiplex theaters, bowling alleys, swimming pools,
international standard cricket pitches, athletic tracks and basketball courts.
We have always endeavored to provide campuses that create a conducive
working environment. One of the most important aspects in all our campuses
is safety. Over the years, we have looked at ways to ensure that we provide
all our employees, including extended employees / support staff, a safe and
positive work environment. Towards this, we have multiple programs and
offerings including technology interventions to support the employees. Our
leadership provides guidance in enforcing a safe working environment for
our employees. We have deployed and in-house safety app and a central
monitoring system to ensure smooth and easy access to various facilities
and ease monitoring of our large fleet operations. The support facilities for
employees also include medical centers, and in-house ambulance support for
emergencies across our campuses.

Talent management
The total number of our employees globally was 194,044 as on March 31,
2016, covering over 129 nationalities. Our employee base comprises about
35.6% women. About 14,000 contract staff (1) (including 2,000 women) work in
non-core activities such as housekeeping, security and maintenance services.
	 The definition of contract staff according to the Contract Labour Act is as follows : ‘Workman’
means any person employed in or in connection with the work of any establishment to do any
skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled manual, supervisory, or clerical work for hire or reward, whether the
terms of employment be express or implied.

Most of our employees work as full-time, permanent employees. We have
a de minimis number of employees working on a part-time / fixed-term
contract. Being an IT services and consulting company, we do not have
seasonal variations in employment.

The remuneration is based on the role an employee performs and his / her
total years of work experience.

We abide by the local employment / labor laws prevailing in the countries
where we operate. All employee benefits are provided to our permanent
(full-time) and part-time / fixed-term employees based on the entitlements
mandated by the law in the countries where we operate and the locations
where we recruit and hire. We do not differentiate our compensation offering
to employees (basic salary and remuneration) based on gender in any of the
locations where we operate.

We are committed to strengthening local hiring practices and continuously
increase the proportion of senior management hires from the local region of
our operations. The proportion of senior management staff hired locally is
around 74%. during fiscal 2016.

Freedom of association

Employee communication

We recognize the right to freedom of association through Collective Bargaining
Agreements (CBAs) as per the laws of the land. Where mandated by the
law, we have 100% employees covered under CBA. We provide policies,
forums and support groups for hearing and addressing the concerns of our
employees, and resolving their issues or conflicts in a fair and transparent
manner. A de minimis percentage of our employees are covered by CBAs. The
minimum notice period for significant operational changes is included in the
CBAs where mandated by law. In countries where there is no such mandate
to include them in the CBA or in countries where CBAs are not mandated, we
abide by the prevailing local laws. In all other scenarios, Infosys prescribes the
notice period based on the type of change in consultation with stakeholders.

We have established multiple channels to engage with our employees across
all levels. In addition, we have employee communication channels such as
townhalls with leaders, organization-wide mailers, newsletters within units,
our corporate intranet (Sparsh), TV channel (InfyTV), radio channel (InfyRadio),
our social networking hub, Yammer, the annual employee satisfaction survey
– LITMUS (Let’s Interact on Themes that Matter to Us), blogs, an exclusive
platform – the Managers Portal and our internal branding portal, MPlus.

their regular jobs. This is a first-of-its-kind initiative in India and is active at seven of our campuses and has had positive
outcomes for over 1,300 employees so far. Network members also support employees with severe depression or
mental health-related concerns by assisting the human resources department and counselors to identify and refer such
employees for further treatment. Samaritans are also engaged in awareness initiatives and conducting internal workshops
on listening, basic counseling skills and addressing issues related to depression and suicidal tendencies.

Work-life balance
The role of professionals in the current social environment demands flexibility
in maintaining an optimal work-life balance. Helping employees attain
personal as well as professional goals creates an engaged workforce. It is this
responsibility that enterprises today are seeking to address through various

to assess the needs of our workforce.
The following are our significant HR policies that support work-life balance
and inclusivity :
•	 Paid maternity leave
•	 Extended maternity leave
•	 Sabbatical for personal reasons (1)
•	 Paternity leave
•	 Adoption leave
•	 Part-time, flexi-hours and selective telecommuting
•	 Sabbatical for community service
•	 Sabbatical for higher education
•	 Work options from satellite offices
•	 Work from home

	 Sabbatical for personal reasons includes leave taken by new parents, or those on account of
sickness, adoption and travel with spouse to onsite location.

Talent fulfilment
In an attempt to balance employee career aspirations and business needs, we
instituted a unique Talent Fulfilment function – a central, organization-wide
talent management function to plan for our talent needs, enhance utilization
of existing talent, improve employee morale through continuous engagement
and re-skill the workforce to the changing business needs. A  dedicated
team of Delivery and HR professionals, as part of this function, engage with
every member moving into the central talent pool after their project expiry.

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

Employees in the talent pool have an opportunity to express their aspirations,
constraints, expectations and record them in our ‘Talent management System’.
The talent fulfillment teams across the world access this system to identify
the right talents based on the skills and availability and map them for their
requirements. This function also focuses on forecasting the talent needs
and planning for the same, ensures timely allocation of talents to projects,
streamlining employee movements across units and locations, planning for
re-skilling and providing inputs for employee retention.
This year we launched Accelerate, a collaborative platform to ensure that
employees who are between projects are positively engaged by creating
opportunities in real-time projects across the organization.

Talent enablement
The Education Training and Assessment (ETA) department is one of our key
business-enabling competency development units. We align our activities
to benefit our business by fostering an enterprise-wide environment for
knowledge acquisition, dissemination and management. ETA has over
2,000 learning programs and interventions that cover the entire competency
spectrum, including technical, managerial, process skills, industry domain
knowledge and leadership skills both for our employees and for our strategic
clients. The training requirements of our employees are assessed based on
roles, domain and individual competency needs. ETA focuses on talent
development and facilitates the Foundation Program, Continuous Education
and Outreach Programs.
The following are learning avenues for our employees within the organization :
––Foundation program
––Continuous education
––Research
––Collaborative learning
––Higher education
––Learning credits

Employee well-being | 27

Continuous education
Our continuous education programs span domains such as technology,
business, process and behavior, and are designed to keep the competencies
of our experienced employees current and relevant to business needs. The
systems and processes that we have created for knowledge management
create an ecosystem for knowledge sharing across the organization.

The Company is an equal opportunity employer and provides training
to all employees and does not differentiate based on gender. Hence, no
information is captured specifically on training efforts by gender. We do not
have transition programs for the management of career endings resulting
from retirements.

Scope : There are specialized enabling programs for the top leadership, such as coaching, mentoring and one-on-one development, which are not included in the table.

The Foundation Program
The Foundation Program is a flagship program that has received recognition
from the American Society for Talent and Development (ASTD). This 21-weeklong residential training program for engineering graduates has helped us
train software engineers who are hired directly from colleges. During fiscal
2016, about 16,000 freshers were trained. This program has been evaluated
by the Federation of International Services (FIS), U.S.

Collaborative learning
Knowledge Management : Collaboration through knowledge sharing is an
important component of learning and education. A primary goal of our
Knowledge Management (KM) strategy has been the creation of an ecosystem
for continuous employee education that effectively combines formal, semiformal and informal learning to enable the sustenance of organizational
productivity, efficiency and quality. Accordingly, several KM solutions have

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

been deployed over the years, individually or in combination with others,
to aid the knowledge-based actions of employees in the broad areas of
technology, methodology and industry domains. These solutions are made
available through multiple channels and are accessible in different modes to
ease collaboration across the organization.
We have provided a number of knowledge management and collaboration
channels to leverage organizational knowledge. These are :
KM Portal : A searchable knowledge repository of about 105,000 artifacts,
which recorded over 855,000 artifact downloads and 5,892 publications in
fiscal 2016 from nearly 94,400 employees in fiscal 2016.
Konnect : A professional networking platform featuring discussions, Q&A,
automatically enriched expert profiles, tagging and support for communities,
Konnect recorded around one million activities from nearly 85,000 employees
in fiscal 2016.

Employee well-being | 28

TeamWiki : An exclusive Wiki-based solution for team collaboration with
versatile site customization and an ability to provide fine-grained access
restrictions on views and edits. About 700,000 activities were recorded from
nearly 35,000 employees in fiscal 2016.
Digital Tutor : A social learning platform that hosts about 2,200 learning
videos on over 290 topics from educators and practitioners. During fiscal
2016, it recorded 745,000 views from nearly 46,000 employees.

Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise (MAKE) Awards
We have received many awards for KM from the external benchmarking
agency, the KNOW network, including 11 Global MAKE Awards, 13 Asian
MAKE Awards and 11 Indian MAKE Awards.

Higher education opportunities for employees
We encourage our employees to pursue higher education programs offered
in part-time / distance learning mode by reputed educational institutes. The
objective of our Higher Education Support (HES) policy is to enhance the

competency and qualifications of our employees and expose them to global
standards of education. As part of this policy, our ETA department identifies
high quality, part-time / distance learning programs at reputed educational
institutes and promotes these among employees. Employees can also avail
extended leave of up to two years to pursue full-time higher education
programs at reputed educational institutions.

Competency Development Program
It has always been our endeavor to enhance the competencies and capabilities
of our employees. We rolled out a holistic Competency Development Program
(CDP) in 2011 and enhanced the framework in 2014 with greater focus on
technical competency and business communication. CDP is a learning
credit point system, which brings relevance and flexibility in competency
development for a role across multiple competency dimensions. The credit
point system is aligned to an employee’s role tenure. The average prescribed
/ estimated learning effort across all employee categories up to senior level,
is computed based on the CDP credit point mechanism.

Creating awareness on the Code of Conduct and Ethics
We believe that converting good governance into action by employees on an
everyday basis is critical to building an ethical organization. To achieve this, a
strong and well-articulated Code of Conduct and Ethics, which also outlines
anti-bribery provisions, has been put in place. This is communicated to all
Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

employees worldwide through training and awareness programs, both online
and instructor-led, using multiple learning media. The programs include talks
by leaders, contests, blogs, portals, and a popular ‘Do you know?’ series
that ensures the dissemination of updated information at regular intervals.
Every employee compulsorily attends a session on values during his or her
induction and acknowledges the Code of Conduct and Ethics through a signEmployee well-being | 29

up process. A Whistleblower Policy, a strong grievance redressal body, an
uncompromising stand on value transgressions, and supportive ecosystems
encourage a culture of disclosure.

Leadership development
The Infosys Leadership Institute (ILI) was established in early 2001. The vision
of ILI is to be a globally respected institution committed to developing
Infosys leaders of today and tomorrow. The primary focus of the institute is

to develop and prepare the title holders of the organization for current and
future executive leadership positions.
An assessment feedback process aids in the creation of a personalized
leadership developmental plan for each leader. ILI employs a wide range
of developmental approaches including classroom training, individualized
coaching, experience sharing, and leaders teach sessions. Over 700 senior
leaders out of a target population of 2,000 have been covered through various
ILI programs and initiatives.

In fiscal 2016, some of the programs offered by ILI were as follows :

Performance and career management
We offer a comprehensive suite of programs, policies, tools and interventions
that facilitate robust performance and career management for our global
workforce.
This year, we revamped our performance management system by moving
from a ‘stack ranking’ model to an ‘open ranking’ model. Under this system,
we provided more flexibility to managers to appraise employees based on
clearly‑defined tasks with a pronounced focus on rewards for performance.
We also launched ‘Compass’, a digital platform to mobilize opportunities on
careers, learning and networks. It is a self-service portal which allows employees
to create a personalized and humanized profile, access opportunities and
leverage organizational resources to find the right expertise, self-directed
learning opportunities and projects. Through Compass, we aim to empower
employees to design their own journey within the organization by enabling
them with the right information, support structure and access.
A management and leadership 360 degree feedback enables managers and
leaders to get a holistic view of their performance. It helps them to take
appropriate actions for enhancing skills and competencies identified through
due analysis of the feedback.

Equal opportunity
We are committed to providing a work environment free of discrimination
and harassment. The Company is an equal opportunity employer and makes
employment decisions based on merit and business needs. The Company
policy prohibits harassment of any kind, including harassment based on
pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, race, religious creed,
color, gender identity, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability,
medical condition, marital status, age, sexual orientation, or any other basis
protected by federal, state, or local law or ordinance or regulation. Any
such harassment is unlawful. The Company’s anti-discrimination and antiharassment policy applies to all persons involved in the operation of the
Company and prohibits harassment by any employee of the Company towards

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

other employees, including supervisors, vendors, and clients. It also prohibits
discrimination or harassment based on the perception that anyone has any of
the characteristics mentioned above, or is associated with a person who has or
is perceived as having any of these characteristics. The Company believes in
equal work opportunities for all employees and does not condone favoritism
or the appearance of favoritism at the workplace. Equal opportunity and fair
treatment are part of our Code of Conduct to which all employees subscribe.
One of the core values of the organization is excellence, and the selection,
compensation and career progression of employees are based on merit.

Diversity and inclusion
Our employees represent people from diverse nationalities, age groups,
cultures, employment histories, and levels of physical ability. We use a multipronged approach to promote diversity and inclusivity within the organization.
The principles and goals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are
at the center of our Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) strategy. Our Diversity and
Inclusion Office works with a vision “to create an inclusive workplace and
leverage the power of D&I for sustainable competitive advantage, where
employees from different backgrounds have the opportunity to participate,
develop and contribute freely and equitably.”
Diversity and Inclusion at Infosys includes work in three broad areas of diversity
that we have identified as vital, viz., Gender, Nationality and Employees with
Disability. The corporate D&I office works through Diversity Councils set up
across business units, subsidiaries and geographies to create ambassadors
for changed action and roll out initiatives. Tightly integrated with our larger
people strategy, the D&I strategy includes corporate goals for D&I in the
corporate scorecard cascaded to the leadership score cards.
Our goals by 2020 include :
•	 25% women in leadership
•	 15% non-Indian nationals in the workforce
•	 A safe and comfortable workplace for employees with disability

Employee well-being | 31

Through the year, the D&I office strives to :
•	 Legitimize diverse perspectives and capabilities, and sensitize the
management on D&I issues
•	 Propagate Infosys culture to bridge differences and enhance commonalities
•	 Assist the talent management strategy by creating and supporting
affinity groups
•	 Network with clients and benchmark D&I practices
Some of our diversity initiatives conducted across our campuses in fiscal 2016
are as follows :

Sit with me – Sitting to take a stand
Every year, International Women’s Day (IWD) is celebrated on March 8,
focusing on various aspects of development and growth of women across
the globe. The United Nations theme for IWD 2016 was ‘Planet 50-50 by
2030 : Step It Up for Gender Equality’. The theme asks governments to make
national commitments to address the challenges that are holding women and
girls back from reaching their full potential. The ‘Step It Up’ campaign was
launched to showcase specific commitments by governments, leading up to
the United Nations General Assembly in 2016.

Business Disability International : Advocating inclusive business enterprises
We founded business disability international (bdi), a not-for-profit social
enterprise, in partnership with other like-minded corporations such as Barclays
and GSK, to pioneer a new conversation between businesses, people with
disabilities and the society. The objective of bdi is to enable organizations
become ‘disability confident’. A disability confident organization is one that
recognizes that disability impacts all parts of the business, identifies and
removes barriers for groups of people, is willing and able to make adjustments,
and does not make assumptions based on people’s disabilities. For more
details, visit http://www.businessdisabilityinternational.org.

At Infosys, we used the opportunity to adopt the theme, ‘Step It Up for
Balanced Leadership’, at the workplace, moving a step closer to our goal of

Occupational health and safety
We are committed to high standards of environmental management and
provisioning of a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, consultants
and contractors. During the year, we worked to enhance our Health, Safety
and Environmental performance through better systems and processes and
the use of technology.

OZONE – The Health, Safety and Environmental
Management System (HSEMS)
We have established a Health, Safety and Environmental Management System
and are certified to OHSAS 18001 specifications at most of our campuses
in India. The HSEMS initiative christened OZONE, helps us comply with all
applicable legal requirements across our operations.
The HSEMS includes well-defined policies and procedures which support the :
•	 Identification and management of hazards and risks related to health
and safety
•	 Identification and management of activities causing environmental impacts
•	 Creation of processes for operational controls
•	 Defining HSE objectives and targets that are achieved through management
programs
•	 Identification of HSE training needs and ensuring periodic training
•	 Establishment and operation of Occupational Health and Safety Committees
•	 Periodic review of HSE performance
Our HSEMS includes the following components :
Risk management : Risk management includes the identification of hazards
for all activities including new or modified activities, products and services,
implementation of measures to minimize or control impacts, and monitoring
the same in a structured manner. Ergonomics-related ailments have been
identified as one of the health concerns which is prevalent in our kind of
environment. Instances of dry eye syndrome and myalgia are reported

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

frequently. Workstations and furniture are designed and procured after
considering their ergonomic advantages. Physiotherapists are available in
most campuses in India and they conduct regular sessions on back care,
posture maintenance and repetitive strain injuries.
Safety committee : Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) Committees
are set up both at the corporate level and at each of our campuses. The
committees comprise employees, management and cross-functional teams.
The representation of employees in Safety Committees is 100%. The OH&S
committee brings employees and the Management together in a nonadversarial, cooperative effort to promote OH&S at the workplace.
The committee is responsible for :
•	 Conducting investigations of reported incidents
•	 Assisting in the development and implementation of the best possible
OH&S policies, plans and procedures for eliminating or minimizing the
occupational risks, and providing an opportunity for raising concerns
related to health and safety
•	 Discussing, exploring and recommending solutions for various OH&Srelated issues
Incident reporting and investigation : Incidents can be reported by employees
through an internal application and also through mails. Incidents which are
reported are investigated and analyzed and appropriate corrective actions
/ preventive measures are taken to reduce future injuries and losses.
Investigations focus on root causes and system failures. The OH&S committee
is responsible for conducting these investigations.
Training on Health, Safety and Environment : Training needs are identified based
on the nature of jobs, which may have a significant impact on the environment
or may pose occupational health and safety risks. Training includes awareness
building, mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS
training is also a part of employee induction programs. E-learning modules
have also been rolled out for creating awareness. An  OHSAS e-learning
module is also available to the global workforce

Employee well-being | 35

A process for tracking and analyzing of occupational incidents has been established (The incident, frequency and severity rates based on the BIS (Bureau of

reported during business travel during this year.
Five supplier-related incidents and one visitor fatality was recorded this year
in our campus.
In the APAC region, there were no reported lost time injuries during the year.
Root cause analysis was carried out and strict measures to mitigate similar
risks across all locations have been undertaken through management
interventions as part of preventive measure. Risk assessments were also
reviewed and appropriate mitigation measures undertaken. We currently do
not have systems in place to capture information about absenteeism rate and
occupational disease rate.
A total of 23 incidents have been reported at our construction sites and two
fatalities have been reported. The health and safety team, in collaboration
with the internal audit team, has embarked on several preventive measures
to improve safety at our construction sites.

Communication channels on Health, Safety and Environmental
(HSE) issues
The HSE team is responsible for ensuring that adequate communication
is provided to all our employees. The team also takes action on the
communication received from both internal and external bodies.
External communication channels : Communication from external bodies
could be through email, letters or fax. Such communication from various
authorities or other stakeholders are directed to the HSE team who record
and respond to the same.
External communication received is of the following types :
•	 Specific communication from interested parties
•	 Communication from statutory / regulatory bodies
•	 Legal notices from courts and other agencies

Employee well-being | 36

•	 Information requests / demands for emergency planning and other relevant
issues by public authorities
Internal communication channels : The HSE policy and procedures are
communicated to all employees through the OZONE portal, handouts and
trainings. Email, signage and the bulletin boards are also used as media for
communication.

Health Assessment and Lifestyle Enrichment (HALE)
Medical research suggests a strong correlation between high work pressure
and stress (coupled with sedentary lifestyles), and heart ailments, hypertension,
depression, mental disorders, suicides, attempts at bodily harm and many
cases of relationship issues. Research also attests to the fact that proactive
interventions leading to early detection, coupled with treatment options and
lifestyle changes can contribute significantly towards enhancing the active
working age of an individual as well as directly impact workplace productivity.
In an attempt to impact health positively and enrich the lifestyles of our
employees, we launched the HALE program across our campuses focusing
on four major areas.
An activity calendar is prepared each year to act as a guideline for activities
at each Development Center (DC). This calendar is made taking into account
employee feedback through surveys and mails, important days outlined by the
World Health Organization (WHO), special occasions, seasonal requirements,
inputs from medical and HSE teams and trends seen in employees’ health. The
calendar acts as a guide to all HALE anchors at different locations to deploy
activities at their respective DCs to ensure maximum reach to employees
and uniformity in major offerings. DC anchors are free to conduct initiatives
in addition to the corporate calendar to make the offerings more relevant to
their location.
Over the years, we have invested in building a positive and world-class work
environment. Interventions in the direction of building a safe and sound
workplace have been launched, including workshops on ergonomics and
sessions at workstations. Taking this a step further to encourage safe and
responsible citizenship, the HALE team also conducts other initiatives to foster
social consciousness – such as blood donation camps and safety campaigns.
Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

Innovation and best practices
HALE Tool : This is an online tool through which employees can assess their
mental and physical health. A customized feedback is made available through
a face-to-face meeting with a professional consultant. Remedial interventions
(cardiac check, psychological counselling, lifestyle change, etc.) are facilitated
based on the need in each case.
HALE Hotline : A hotline facility has been made available 24 hours a day, 365
days a year to provide professional counseling in times of crisis. Callers are
provided instant access to a trained professional. Through this initiative, a
number of cases have been addressed, including cases of serious depression,
attempted suicides and marital problems.
Stress Audit Tool : A tool that assists employees to identify their stress levels
and thereby to seek help or take appropriate measures to improve their
health.
‘Healthy You’ application : A desktop widget providing health tips at the click
of a button. In addition to the above, we also use our communication channels
such as InfyRadio, InfyTV, our intranet – Sparsh, blogs and mailers to spread
awareness.

Environmental stewardship

Environmental stewardship
The blue planet may be in peril. The ever-increasing population and the
ever‑rising demand for resources is driving our natural environment beyond
its coping capacity. The threat of climate change looks very real and grave.
For an organization like ours, the impact could be multi-faceted. An energy
crisis stemming from the threat could have an adverse impact on business and
operational costs. The scarcity of water could disrupt day-to-day operations and
greater incidence of natural disasters could impact not just our physical assets
and client commitments but also life and physical safety of our workforce. Now
more than ever, we need to be decisive about protecting our environment.
At Infosys, environment sustainability is well-evolved and deep-rooted. Over
the years, we have significantly improved our resource footprint through
investments in real-time monitoring to gauge performance, innovative
solutions for resource conservation, and strategic partnerships to learn and
collaborate for a better tomorrow.
Focusing on the ecosystem and environmental conservation is ingrained in
the way we conduct our business. We have identified four aspects that are
material to our business – Energy, Emissions, Water and Waste.
In line with our corporate philosophy of ‘be more’, we have taken some
audacious goals. In 2011, we committed at the United Nations to become
carbon neutral, reduce per capita electricity consumption by 50% (against the
baseline year 2008), and use 100% renewable power for electricity by 2018.
Since then, we have made significant progress and are on our way to fulfill
our commitments.
Buildings : It has been our endeavor to make our buildings and campuses
smart, connected, and resource-efficient. Our smart buildings across 11
locations in India are connected to our central monitoring station, the central
command center, in Bangalore. Our command center is now managing 138
buildings online, covering about 45 million sq. ft. of built-up area across
different campuses in India.

We have implemented several transformational technologies, including the
highly efficient radiant cooling technology and the in-house developed
radiflux cooling solution. We have implemented these new technologies in
our new buildings to achieve the highest levels of energy efficiency. Our
deep green retrofits in areas like air conditioning, UPS, and lighting retrofits
continue to fetch us considerable reductions in energy use. Through these
retrofits, we have achieved about 28 MW of reduction in connected load.
In absolute terms, our total electricity consumption has increased only by 18%
even though our employee strength has gone up by 133% since 2008. Over
the last eight years, we have managed to reduce our per capita electricity
consumption by about 49.69%.
Energy : We are committed to achieving our goal of meeting our entire
electricity demands from renewable energy (RE). This is further reinforced by
the fact that we became the first company in India to join the RE100, a global
platform for major companies committed to 100% renewable power. We are
on track to achieving this goal by installing more RE capacity and procuring
more RE power. We have installed 12 MW of solar PV systems across our
campuses so far, including the 6.6 MW of solar PV plant in Hyderabad (SEZ)
campus which can help us meet 100% of our electricity needs with renewable
energy for Hyderabad SEZ campus. Along with building captive capacity, we
have increased our RE power procurement through open access over the
years.
Emissions : We have been accounting and reporting our carbon footprint
since 2008. Our efforts in energy efficiency and the use of RE have helped us
reduce our carbon footprint by about 59% across our scope 1 and 2 emissions.
As part of our carbon neutrality commitment, we are implementing carbon
offset projects with the goal of offsetting our scope 1 and scope 3 emissions.

We continue to build high performance buildings and today we have 14 LEED
(Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) India Platinum and four GRIHA

Water : Our water conservation strategy revolves around three aspects – reduce,
recycle and reuse. We have implemented several water-efficient fixtures and
technologies, including pressure-compensating aerators, waterless urinals,
and key valves, among others, to reduce our water consumption. With our
focused efforts to harvest rainwater, today we have 149 recharge wells and
25 lakes across our campuses. Above all, we are continuously monitoring our
water use through smart water metering to eliminate wastage and optimize
consumption. With our constant efforts to reduce dependency on freshwater
with the use of water-efficient technology and rainwater harvesting, we have
been able to reduce our per capita fresh water consumption by 41.41%
compared to 2008 levels.
Waste : In this era of rapid urbanization, waste represents a serious threat to
the society. At Infosys, we are relentlessly working towards achieving ‘zero
waste to landfills’. In our approach to integrated waste management, we have
engineered innovative biogas plants and organic waste converters to recycle
food waste into biogas and rich manure, and reuse the gas in kitchens and
manure in landscaping within campuses. We are working towards installing
biogas plants and organic waste converters across our campuses to ensure
onsite recycle and reuse of our food waste.
Advocacy and partnerships : For us, it’s not just important to make our
own business sustainable but we have embarked upon a journey to make
sustainability an everyday practice for the larger world. Over the years, we
have been persistently sharing our best practices and experiences with the
larger communities to push for a sustainable tomorrow. We are closely working
with the government, both at state and national levels to advocate changes
to policies and guidelines to promote environmental sustainability. We have
shared our experiences in efficient building designs and technologies with
several government departments to help them develop guidelines and
policies for the country to move towards sustainable development. We have
been partnering with some of the best research institutes and adopting best
practices from across the world to implement the latest technologies in India.
We have collaborated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL),
U.S.; University of California, Berkeley, Center for Built Environment (CBE),
U.S.; National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), US; Indian Institute of

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

Science (IISc), Bangalore; Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay; and The
Institute for Sanitary Engineering and Waste Management (ISAH), Germany.
Awards : This year we also won the prestigious Microsoft Supplier Program
Climate Change Leadership Award. This award is instituted by Microsoft in
collaboration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Center
for Corporate Climate Leadership and closely mirrors the requirements for
EPA’s Climate Leadership Awards and therefore a prestigious one. Factors like
supplier’s management of climate change risks and opportunities, established
Carbon reduction goals, third-party verification of carbon footprint, external
disclosures like CDP Climate Change and CDP Supply Chain are all taken into
account when determining the award recipient.
Our motto is to continuously innovate and nurture new ideas. We will continue
to follow this and demonstrate leadership in implementing innovative
technologies and setting new benchmarks in environmental sustainability.
By implementing sustainable practices across our campuses in India and
engaging with external organizations and the governments, we are striving
to encourage other stakeholders towards safeguarding the environment. Our
experiences, best practices and innovative solutions will play a critical role
in mainstreaming sustainability for a low carbon future. We will continue our
focus on innovations in resource conservation, strategic partnerships, setting
tough goals and constantly monitoring performance, to improve our resource
intensity.
We comply with applicable environmental regulations in the countries where
we operate. Our resource-intensity efforts are driven by aggressive targets
beyond compliance benchmarks. There have been no instances of monetary or
non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance and no environmental grievances
reported to us in our operations during fiscal 2016.
All our existing campuses are situated on government-approved land
(industrial zones). None of our campuses fall within or are adjacent to
protected areas or high-biodiversity areas, as notified in the siting guidelines
issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. We
also conduct environmental-impact assessment studies for all new projects,
wherever applicable, covering the impacts related to air, water, social aspects,
biodiversity, etc., within a 10-km radius of the proposed project site.
Environmental Stewardship | 47

Keeping the momentum
During the year, we continued our focused efforts in resource conservation,
renewable energy, and emission reduction and offset. Some of our key
initiatives that were undertaken in this year are as follows :

Energy
Command center
We continue to integrate our systems and buildings with our command center
to enable online monitoring and to achieve operational excellence. During
fiscal 2016, all our campuses across India have been interlinked through
the Central Energy Management System (CEMS) by integrating more than
3,000 energy meters from various systems. Also, SMS alerts for lighting and
computer power consumption during unoccupied hours have been enabled
to take immediate corrective actions and eliminate wastage. The command
center now has utility‑wise (HVAC, UPS, lighting, raw power and miscellaneous)
energy performance benchmarking for all our buildings based on accurate
data. As part of our ongoing smart water metering program, we have deployed
smart water meters and linked them to our central command center for
continuous monitoring of water use across different locations in real time,
significantly optimizing water consumption.

Personalized comfort through Comfy
In our constant endeavor to enhance employee comfort and productivity,
we have piloted a smart personalized workspace monitor at the Infosys SDB
5, Mysore, called the ‘comfy’ application. Comfy is an application that helps
employees to warm or cool their workspace according to their needs and
comfort. Comfy has enabled employees to control their workplace temperature
using smartphones, laptops or desktops. Comfy works over the building
management system and provides instant streams of cool air or warms the
space and learns from occupant feedback. Employees act as sensors, allowing
Comfy to save energy by eliminating over-conditioning and turning off air
conditioning in unoccupied spaces. This system-level automation has been
done for the first time in India and has empowered the employees to control
their comfort environment, improving their building experience.

Comfy application helps employees control their workplace ambience

Radiant cooling in our new buildings
Infosys pioneered the radiant cooling technology in India and demonstrated
with adequate data that it is a viable solution for cooling buildings in an
energy-efficient way. We strongly believe that the radiant cooling technology
can bring about a transformation in the way we cool our buildings. Thus, we
continue to implement this technology in our new buildings across campuses.
Today, we have a total area of 2.6 million sq. ft. with radiant cooling across
seven buildings in five different locations in India.

Radiflux used in new buildings
The Radiflux cooling solution, with patents pending in the U.S., Europe and
India, has been designed and developed by Infosys to address the challenges
with existing radiant cooling systems. The first set of radiflux panels were
installed in one of our buildings in Bangalore and we continue to implement
it in buildings across different locations. This year, we have installed radiflux

Environmental Stewardship | 48

panels in two of our buildings in Pune and Jaipur. We plan to deploy this
efficient and cost effective cooling solution in all our future buildings to further
optimize our energy use.

Renewable energy update
Infosys is striving to lead the way to build a low carbon future. Our
concentrated efforts to meet the goal of sourcing our entire electricity
demand from renewables have fetched us great results this year. This year,
we installed about 9.7 MW of solar PV across our campuses, taking the total
installed capacity to 12 MW. With a total capacity of 6.6 MW and a potential
for generating 12 million kWh of electricity every year, the new solar plant at
our Hyderabad campus can help us meet 100% of our electricity needs with
renewable energy. The location-wise installed capacity of solar PV installation
in fiscal 2016 is as follows :

Green buildings
This fiscal, we were awarded the LEED India Platinum rating for two of our
buildings in Pune and Bangalore, and GRIHA five-star rating for two of our
buildings in Hyderabad. This makes a total of 14 LEED India and four GRIHA
five-star rated buildings in different locations across India.

Retrofits to reduce connected load
We have been persistent in our efforts to bring in highest efficiency levels in
our existing buildings by implementing the world’s largest energy efficiency
retrofit program across India. This initiative still continues and has expanded,
leading to drastic reductions in energy use. In fiscal 2016, air-conditioning and
UPS retrofits have resulted into 2.5 MW and 2 MW reduction in connected
load, making a total reduction of 16 MW and 12 MW respectively in the last
five years. These achievements are all the more impressive given that most of
these retrofits have an average payback of about three years and can be easily
replicated in large scale, making sound commercial as well as environmental
sense. This deep green retrofits program is a great example for other large
businesses in India and worldwide to emulate.

Façade retrofit

Our performance : Energy

Building façade acts as a shield to the building which greatly impacts cooling,
lighting, and occupant comfort, thereby affecting the overall performance
of the building. We continue to carry out façade retrofits in the buildings
identified through our command center as having high energy consumption
due to building facade. This year, one of the buildings in Chennai has been
retrofitted with insulation to reduce the amount of glass on the façade
without affecting the building appearance. This retrofit has reduced the heat
ingress by about 25%, thereby reducing the cooling energy consumption and
improving occupant comfort. We plan to implement façade retrofits in other
buildings across our campuses in the coming years.

Our direct energy consumption within our organization takes place mainly
through the use of electricity, high-speed diesel used for generators and
boilers, the petrol / diesel used in company-owned vehicles, and other
equipment. Based on significance of the impact (5% threshold defined) and
the potential for reductions that could be undertaken or influenced by the
organization, energy consumption outside our boundary is not relevant.
The direct energy consumed in our operations in various areas in fiscal year

SMS alerts for lighting energy
Granular energy metering data analyzed at the command center gave us an
indication of lighting energy consumption during non-working hours in several
buildings. To overcome this, we have deployed SMS alerts in our building
management systems (BMS), which sends alerts to the building managers
to turn off lights in unoccupied spaces, for BMS-enabled buildings. This is
helping our building managers to easily identify energy wastage in buildings
and take immediate corrective action.

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

The direct energy consumed in overseas operations for electricity (APAC
region and locations with data centers) during fiscal 2016 was 38,373.89 GJ.

Electricity
We have taken up an aggressive target to reduce our per capita electricity
consumption by 50% by fiscal 2018, against our baseline of fiscal 2008. In
fiscal year 2016, we have reduced our per capita electricity consumption by
6.54% over the last year at our India locations. Overall, we have achieved
49.69% per capita reduction in our electricity consumption against the
baseline set in fiscal year 2008.

Our focus has always been on increasing our share of renewable energy. We
have achieved this by sourcing green power at a few locations, harnessing
solar energy onsite, for water heating and electricity requirements. During
fiscal 2016, we used 69.80 million units of green power, which is about
26.4% of overall electricity requirements of our campuses in India. We saw
a drop in the overall renewable electricity procurement, owing to regulatory
constraints in some states. During the same period, 4,937 MWh of electricity
was produced from our solar PV systems in our campuses.

Case in point – Our solar-powered campus
The Indian government has revised its commitment to scale up solar energy
– from 20 GW to 175 GW – to be achieved by 2022. Infosys is leading the
way and pushing to expand its solar installed capacity to contribute to the
county’s solar target.
One of our greatest achievements this year has been to completely power
our Hyderabad SEZ campus with renewable energy. As part of the ambitious
goal of sourcing 100% electricity from renewables, we have installed a 6.6
MW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant in this campus, capable of generating 12
million units annually.
We identified that Infosys Hyderabad campus was consuming about 11 million
units (kWh) of electricity per annum. We saw a huge opportunity to set up a
solar power plant to offset the entire energy consumption of this campus. The
solar power plant has been conceptualized with top notch designs, experts
and innovative strategies to build a state-of-the-art solar installation.

This plant has an innovative design with two PV Technologies, namely
Polycrystalline silicon and Copper Indium Selenide CIS thin film. The
uniqueness is that these technologies have been installed with two different
types of installation methods – fixed tilt and single axis tracker based
system. In the fixed tilt system, all the solar modules are facing southwards
at a common angle, ensuring maximum number of sunny days are utilized,
generating maximum energy. Whereas in the single axis tracker system, solar
modules face the sun directly throughout the day from east to west. The
100% self-powered tracker moves along with the sun’s movement the entire
day. Since the climatic conditions of Hyderabad combines both clear sky days
and diffused radiation day (cloudy), our PV technologies make the best use
of both the climatic conditions, thereby significantly increasing the energy
yield. Additionally, we have created high accuracy weather stations which
help us verify actual radiation and actual generation to ensure efficient plant
performance. We are ensuring continuous online monitoring of the plant to
achieve operational excellence.
A plant of this capacity, typically generates 4,300-4,800 units per MW
per  day. However, because of our innovations described above, we have
seen electricity generation of 5,000-6,000 units per MW per day. This level of
innovation has never been done in the solar PV industry so far. Based on the
current generation, we expect solar power plant to avoid about 9,900 tons of
carbon emissions annually. The new solar plant at our Hyderabad campus can
help us meet 100% of our electricity needs with renewable energy.

Emissions

GHG emissions

During the past decade, carbon emissions have become synonymous with
global warming and climate change. At Infosys, we have been accounting and
reporting our carbon footprint since 2008. Over the years we have endeavored
to reduce our carbon emissions through specific initiatives. In  2011, we
have taken a big leap by committing our India business to become carbon
neutral across all emissions by 2017-2018. While our scope 2 emissions will
be addressed through the use of 100% renewable power for electricity, our
scope 1 and scope 3 emissions will be addressed through carbon offsets.

In line with the GHG Protocol, we have categorized our GHG emissions as
direct and indirect based on the following criteria :

Although the option of procuring inexpensive carbon offsets from the market
was open to us, we made a conscious choice to source our offsets from
community projects that create real and lasting socio-economic co-benefits.
By supporting such projects throughout its lifecycle, we are not only catalyzing
those projects, but also co-creating socio-economic value.
During the year, we have started three carbon offset projects; one of them
is a household biogas project and the other two are high efficiency biomass
cookstove projects. Together, they will generate approximately 30% of our
carbon offset requirement in 2017-18.

•	 Direct GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or
controlled by the reporting entity.
•	 Indirect GHG emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the activities
of the reporting entity, but occur at sources owned or controlled by another
entity.
•	 The GHG Protocol further categorizes these direct and indirect emissions
into three broad scopes – scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3.
•	 We use ‘Operation Control’ as the consolidation approach for emission
calculation and reporting.
Source : http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards/corporate-standard
Note : This section addresses the GRI G4-22 disclosure.

Our main sources of indirect GHG emissions include electricity consumption,
fuel consumption in food courts, business travel and employee commute.

Our performance : Emissions
Our main emissions from our support activities include greenhouse gases
(GHG), SOx, NOx and other ozone-depleting substances. Emissions from
the stacks connected to generators, boilers and diesel operated fire hydrant
pumps are monitored on a monthly basis.

Case in point – Setting up smoke-free kitchens through offsets
A whopping 67% of Indian rural households still depend on traditional
cooking using firewood, according to the Ministry of Statistics, Government
of India. Nearly a million deaths a year in India are attributed to household
air pollution from cooking. Access to clean and smokeless cooking solutions
will not only reduce mortality associated with household air pollution from
traditional cooking, but also avoid the drudgery of firewood gathering.
Since our ‘2018 carbon neutrality goal’ commitment at the United Nations, we
have been constantly working to reduce our footprint; be it through efficient
building designs, investments in green power procurement or solar-powered
buildings or the innovations in the ‘radiant-cooled’ technology. These efforts
have resulted in significant reduction in energy consumption as well as
reducing our carbon footprint.
This year, we began our journey of exploring carbon offset projects. While we
had the option of purchasing low-cost projects from the market, we traversed
the extra mile to choose projects that would have a lasting impact not just on
the environment but also on local communities.

Biogas, generated from cow dung, offers a clean and smokeless cooking
solution to rural households. Being a form of renewable energy, biogas
does not emit CO2 while burning other cooking fuels do. It also avoids
the generation and release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, through
anaerobic digestion of cow dung in storage pits.
Infosys, through our partner NGO, SKG Sangha, has undertaken to build
7,620 biogas units in the district of Ramanagara in Karnataka. Depending
on the size of the family and the number of cattle they own, the beneficiary
families will be given either a 2 cubic meter or a 3 cubic meter capacity biogas
units. These units can respectively generate biogas equivalent to about two
or three domestic LPG cylinders per month. As part of the project, we will
also undertake the long-term maintenance and monitoring of these units.
Delivering strong and lasting socio-economic and environmental benefits,
the Ramanagara biogas project represents our commitment to sustainable
development.

Under the Ramanagara biogas project, Infosys aims to build biogas units and provide cook stoves to 7,620 households which were earlier dependent on polluting, traditional
cooking methods

Water
Rainwater harvesting
In our constant efforts to harvest every drop of rainwater in our campuses, we
have achieved significant milestones. During this fiscal, we have constructed
46 recharge wells in different campuses to maximize water sequestration and
increase groundwater levels. Today, we have a total of 149 recharge wells
with a potential to harvest about 7.4 million liters per day, for groundwater
recharge across different campuses in India.

Smart water metering
Continuing the data-driven approach to managing our water use, we have
extensively expanded our smart water metering initiative to several locations
across India. This year, we installed 273 smart water meters across our Mysore,
Thiruvananthapuram and Chennai campuses. Today, we have a total of 472
smart water meters installed across different campuses in India, enabling
online monitoring of water consumption and significantly optimize use. We
plan to deploy smart water meters across all our campuses and link them
all to our command center for continuous online monitoring, improving the
efficiency of our water conservation efforts.

Our performance : Water
Our fresh water consumption is solely for the purpose of human sustenance.
Hence, we believe that we do not significantly impact water resources. We
have focused on reducing our per capita fresh water consumption through
various initiatives.
Our aim is to make our campuses water sustainable. Water sustainability
strategy across our campuses includes reducing our fresh water consumption,
rainwater harvesting, and recycle and reuse of wastewater. Our effort to
reduce fresh water consumption includes and is not limited to installation
of pressure-reducing valves in taps and pipes, the use of flow restrictors and
installation of sensor taps in high-density areas. For the current fiscal year, we
have recycled and reused 2,701,600 kl of water, which amounts to 72.78% of

	 Per capita consumption is computed by dividing the average monthly water consumption in our
locations by the average employee count for the month. Employee count is the sum of the swipe
count of employees and number of support staff in our offices. The average monthly employee
count considered for fiscal year 2016 is 146,946 and covers all India locations. The average monthly
water consumption considered for the per capita calculations, does not include the plantation
related consumptions at Mangalore SEZ, Thiruvananthapuram SEZ and Hyderabad SEZ (totaling to
annual consumption of 323,278 kl).

Environmental Stewardship | 58

In fiscal 2016, we reduced our per capita water consumption by 12.20% over
the last year at our India locations We have reduced our per capita fresh water
consumption by 41.41% as of fiscal year 2016 against the baseline figure of
fiscal year 2008 at our India locations.
Water consumption for the APAC region has been estimated based on
the seating capacity at these locations and per capita per month water
consumption in India locations. This is deemed conservative, given that all
offices are based out of leased facilities and thereby the consumption is
restricted to human touch purposes only. The annual fresh water consumption
in for the APAC region is estimated at about 11,832.48 kl.

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

Wastewater treatment
All the wastewater at our campuses is treated and reused for toilet flushing,
landscaping, and in cooling towers. The use of treated water is also optimized
through dual-flush toilets, and sensor-based urinals. Owing to stringent
wastewater recycling and reuse systems, we have not released any significant
amount of untreated wastewater into the municipal sewage systems during
fiscal year 2016. The treated water quality is monitored regularly to ensure
adherence to applicable environmental norms.

Environmental Stewardship | 59

Case in point – Making every drop count
Water availability is a serious concern across the globe. India continues to be
trapped under severe water crisis and if constant measures to conserve water
are not undertaken, we will soon be a water-stressed economy. It is vital to
add value to water by metering and monitoring the consumption, and being
aware of the wastage points for immediate rectification.
Infosys strives to become water sustainable and has implemented a host of
efficiency measures to optimize water use to the highest possible levels. For
us, data is critical. As a result, we have installed smart water metering program
on a massive scale to enable online monitoring of water consumption, and
identify leakages, wastages and opportunities for reduction. These full bore
electromagnetic meters facilitate granular-level metering and monitoring
of water consumption in real time and ensure accurate measuring of water
flow. These electromagnetic flow meters are integrated with the building
management systems, which are remotely monitored through the command
center in Bangalore. Campuses with smart water metering have an online
water balance to measure water distribution and consumption points, water
flowing into sewage treatment plants, and also recycled water. Operations
data flowing into the command center from various sources is used to
review and optimize water consumption, and perform leakage detection and
diagnostics.
Smart innovative user interface has helped us identify areas of unaccounted
water consumption, leading to significant water savings. For example, in our
Pune campus, we were able to reduce our per capita water consumption by
about 24% compared to fiscal 2015, by identifying and plugging leakages
with the installation of smart water meters.

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

This system can be easily implemented anywhere across the world on a large
scale and result in considerable water savings. In the long run, it is likely
to have a big impact on water consumption levels. We believe that smart
water metering and monitoring will play a crucial role in conserving large
amounts of water, tackling the looming water crisis and achieving our water
sustainability goals.

Waste
Our initiatives on waste management are spread across three dimensions,
namely, influencing social behavior, process optimization and the
implementation of technology.

Influencing social behavior
Employee engagement and awareness programs are conducted across all
campuses through eco clubs, to sensitize employees on waste management
and achieve segregation at source.

Process optimization
The waste generation patterns are continuously monitored on our campuses
and the process of waste management is modified accordingly.
We have been constantly directing our efforts to treat 100% of our food waste
onsite to minimize the amount of waste going out of our campuses. We have
installed biogas plants in our campuses to convert food waste into biogas,
and in turn, reuse the gas in our food court kitchens.

Our performance : Waste
We have been persistent in our efforts to ensure reuse, recycling, and the
responsible disposal of waste, and have a scientific approach towards
waste management. We provide products, consultancy and services in the
information technology domain. Hence, our operations do not result in the
release of any significant waste, and also do not necessitate the use of any
natural or recycled raw materials for packaging goods and services. Our
suppliers are encouraged to reuse the packaging material used in the supply
of goods to us.
Waste is segregated at source, stored and disposed to authorized recyclers,
in adherence to applicable legislations. Hazardous waste and e-waste are
disposed to recyclers, who possess the required clearances from the Pollution
Control Boards of governments where we have our operations.

Food waste is handled by our in-house biogas and organic waste converters.
We have 9.25 TPD installed capacity of biogas plants across our Mysore,
Bangalore, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, Pune and Bhubaneshwar
campuses. In addition to biogas plants, we have 2.5 TPD installed capacity
of composting plants in our Mysore, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chandigarh,
Jaipur, Thiruvananthapuram and Mangalore campuses. Paper waste is sent
for recycling in Bangalore and Mysore campuses. The vendor recycles the
paper and provides recycled products in return.

Case in point – Energy through food waste
Rapid urbanization has increased the amount of waste generated by
households and businesses, turning landfills into hazardous and unmanageable
spaces. Untreated food waste generates methane, which may lead to severe
environmental impact and may lead to contamination of water, soil, and
air, creating breeding grounds for pathogens and resulting in grave health
problems. Thus, it is critical to manage food waste using scientific methods
to mitigate the related effects on human health and the environment.
Being a responsible organization, Infosys has been persistently trying out
innovative methods and technologies to treat food waste scientifically. This
year, we have installed an innovative biogas plant, having a capacity of 2 tons
/ day, in our Bangalore campus to treat our food waste onsite and use the
output – biogas – for cooking in our food courts. Through optimized design
and detailed engineering, we were able to achieve a biogas plant with highest
levels of operational efficiency.
We have optimized our biogas plant at every stage of the gas generation
process. This plant consists of a unified feeding system, which helps us achieve
an adequate mixing ratio and ensures feeding of food waste in just two and a
half hours. Geysers have been replaced with high-efficiency heat pumps for
optimizing energy use, leading to over 60% energy savings in heating. The
innovative design of the burner helps us deliver a better cooking experience
by arresting unwanted flaring and maximizing gas utilization.

The plant is estimated to generate about 140 m3 of gas per ton of food waste
compared to regular biogas plants with about 70 m3 / ton. Our biogas plant
in Bangalore campus has seen an actual production rate of 235 m3 / ton,
which is equivalent to 117 kgs of LPG. This translates to an attractive payback
period of about three years.
Infosys is leading from the front in this area and has set new benchmarks in the
industry by piloting new technologies and ideas to ensure reduce, recycle and
reuse of waste effectively. Infosys’ efforts in waste management are helping
divert considerable amount of waste going out of our campuses. This is
leading to reduced cost of transportation, carbon emission mitigation, and
also minimized environmental impacts like land degradation, air pollution,
and groundwater contamination, among others.
The following diagram shows how biogas is generated from food waste in
our plants.

Biogas generated is

The plant is fully-automated and integrated with the building management
system to facilitate online monitoring on a continuous basis. This has minimized
manual intervention and enabled continuous monitoring of critical parameters
to ensure health of the plant and long-term efficiency. Monitoring also helps
in ensuring biological stability on a daily basis, so that preemptive measures
can be implemented to avoid plant failure.

Biodiversity
In our endeavor to conserve and promote biodiversity, we continue to plant
trees to enhance our flora and fauna. We plant diverse species of tress native
to the region to support local fauna. Native species require less water for
growth and also provide a feeding and nesting ground for birds. This fiscal,
we planted 80,621 trees across our campuses, taking the total to 495,621
trees in the last eight years.

Strategic partnerships and advocacy
We are working closely with the following organizations to further research in
building energy efficiency :
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), U.S. : Our continuous
collaboration with LBNL is focused on several aspects of buildings such as high
efficiency data centers, customized comfort solutions, monitoring systems and
developing best practice guidelines for buildings. We recently completed
implementation of one of our most efficient data centers in Bangalore, with
a design PUE of 1.08, using passive cooling technology.
University of California, Berkeley, Center for Built Environment (CBE), U.S. :
We have partnered with CBE to conduct research on enhancing employees’
comfort, productivity, and experience in our buildings by improving the built
environment. This study is currently under way. This is among one of the very
few studies conducted globally.
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), U.S. : We strive to accelerate
and scale up the best-in-the-world solar technologies and solutions for
expanding the solar market in India. NREL is helping us with methodologies for
critical evaluation in several areas such as, comparison of solar technologies,
measuring impact of soiling losses and panel temperature on module
performance, etc.

3M : We are working with 3M to evaluate their new technologies that can help
in enhancing natural light in office spaces. We are also pursuing research on
different technologies for improving light fixture efficiency.

Restatements
The water consumption for fiscal 2015 changed from 3,690,874kl to
3,779,702 kl because of the following reasons :
•	 Inclusion of landscape water consumption.
•	 Inclusion of actual value from bill for TVM SEZ, for March 2015, instead of
internal metered values (The actual bills were not available during the last
reporting cycle).
As a result of the above, the per capita water consumption for fiscal 2015 has
changed from 2.36 to 2.19.

Environmental Stewardship | 63

Annexure 1 : Data computational methods
The following parameters and conventions have been used for calculating
data for emissions, fresh water and electricity consumption in the report :

Intensity calculations
The information on employee numbers based on swipe count is captured on a
monthly basis for Infosys Limited and Infosys BPO Limited, campus-wise. The
average count is arrived at after excluding weekends, holidays, and working
days where the employee count is less than 10% of the maximum count in a
particular month. The count of the contractual staff is added to this total and
this count remains more or less constant with a variation of +/- 5%. The count
of visitors is not included.
Total employee count = Average employee count
Average employee count is the sum of the swipe count of employees and
number of support staff in our offices. The average monthly employee count
considered for fiscal 2016 covers all India locations.
(Infosys Limited and Infosys BPO Limited) + count of contractual staff

SOx and NOx calculations
To arrive at the SOx and NOx emissions, the average emission rate, running
hours of diesel generators and boilers per month, and the oxides of Sulphur
and Nitrogen are first computed.
The exhaust stacks are monitored for the net emission calculation for the
following :
•	 Concentration of SOx and NOx emissions
•	 Flow rate of exhaust gases
•	 Running hours of diesel generators (DG) and boilers

Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

The following formulae are used for the final computation :
SOx = (SOx X Emission rate / 1,000) X (Running hours of DG and boilers)
NOx = (NOx X Emission rate / 1,000) X (Running hours of DG and boilers)

Energy
Our Energy consumption within our operations includes electricity from grid,
fuel used in diesel generators and company owned vehicles and equipment.
The energy consumption outside the organization consists of fuel used in
personal and commercial vehicles used by our employees for daily commute
to our offices and business travel and fuel used in our food courts. The
energy data is calculated by using suitable conversion factors for electricity
and various fuel sources as defined in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

GHG emissions
The GHG emissions are computed for the three scopes based on the de
minimis / threshold values defined for Infosys. All categories of emissions
which fall within 5% of the overall emissions are considered to be significant
and reported. Below are the significant emission categories for Infosys :

Scope 1
Stationary combustion
The total monthly quantity of high speed diesel (fuel) combusted by diesel
generators and boilers is captured and used for the emission computation.
The emission factor for high speed diesel is sourced from the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

Environmental Stewardship | 64

Mobile combustion

To calculate the total scope 2 emissions, we have used the latest emission
factors for grid electricity provided by the Central Electricity Authority for
India and country specific emission factors provided by DEFRA for overseas
locations.

The total monthly quantity of diesel and petrol used by Company-owned
vehicles and lawn mowers is considered. The emission factor for diesel /
petrol is sourced from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories.

Scope 3

Stationary combustion – Onsite – solar power generation

Other indirect emissions include :

The total quantity of electricity generated in kWh at each site is sourced from
energy meters. The emissions due to onsite power generation from renewable
sources such as solar and wind is considered to be ‘zero’.

Business travel

Fugitive emissions – Refrigerants used in AC equipment
HVAC systems are a basic requirement of our industry. Various refrigerants are
used for the air conditioners, each of which has a different global warming
potential. The total weight (in kg) of the refrigerant refilled during the
service of air conditioning systems is captured from the service reports. This
consolidated quantity based on the different refrigerants is used for the GHG
computation using emission factors sourced from DEFRA.

Fugitive emissions – SF6 in electrical circuit breaks
Some of the electrical breakers installed in our campuses contain SF6, which
might be refilled during the course of maintenance. The information on the
quantity of SF6 used for refilling the electrical breakers, if any, from the service
report is collated and the total GHG emissions computed using emission
factors sourced from DEFRA.

Scope 2
This includes the emissions from the generation of purchased electricity.

Purchased electricity consumption
A major portion of our electricity is sourced from government agencies or
other utility providers who provide invoices on a monthly basis. This is used
to capture information on the units consumed during the month in a location,
and this information is recorded on the dashboard.
Infosys Sustainability Report 2015-16

Business travel comprises long and short distance air travel globally, and
commute through surface transportation including trains, buses, cabs, etc., for
business requirements. iTravel, an internal application, provides an integrated,
end-to-end web-based solution for the travel needs of our employees. This
solution is integrated with all Company policies, business processes, rules
and validations and it captures the total distance travelled.
The emissions due to business travel is estimated based on the fuel efficiency,
the total distance travelled and the fuel characteristics like Net Calorific Value
(NCV), density and emission factor for the fuel used.
Our total scope 3 emissions have decreased by 1.02% over fiscal year 2014.
The emissions from business travel are based on the DEFRA emission factors.

Employee commute
Employees commute to office and back by various means including Companyprovided transportation, personal vehicles and public transport. The total
number of two-wheeler and four-wheeler parking slots available on our
campuses is considered for personal transport assuming it is occupied 100%.
The data for carpooling is considered as 5% of the total four-wheeler parking
slots. The information on the total number of bus users is provided by the
transport team, which covers the number of people travelling by Companyprovided transportation. The difference between the total number of
employees and the sum of personal transport users and Company-provided
transport users gives the total number of users using public transport. This
information is used to compute GHG emissions.

Environmental Stewardship | 65

During this year, the emissions due to employee commute has been
estimated based on the fuel efficiency, the total distance travelled and the

fuel characteristics like NCV, density and emission factor for the fuel used,
which has reduced the emissions.
